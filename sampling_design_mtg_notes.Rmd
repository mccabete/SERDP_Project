# Overview

1. Reviewed installations visited and goal of revisiting these plus 6+ new installations.

2. Reminded everyone of new plot design

We think we can get three or so of these done per day, on average.


# Main goal: how do we best balance our sampling effort?


We have three nested organizational levels of sampling:

1. Installation

    2. Burn unit (which has a time-since-fire & fire return interval)
    
        3. Plot
        
        
**We need to sample installations across the latitudinal gradient during the same season.** Last season focused on southerly sites as we familiarized ourselves with the sampling effort. 

Resampling at installations will first focus on taking measurements at plots that were burned during the last year. Subject to change, additional sampling effort will then be focused on establishing plots new plots in *new, previously unsampled* burn units. 

However, resampling the same plots does help address  changes in vegetation, and tick and tick host abundances; these changes may be more rapid in the first 1-3 years following fire, so in a situation where sampling new burn units it may be beneficial to resample plots in these time-since-fire stratifications. 

    - Tess needs change in vegetation, especially for cogongrass

To maximize the potential for measuring the before/after effect of fire we can target burn units that are planned to be burned - this could be especially powerful if these burn units also span a relatively wide range of time-since-last fire.

We will also establish at least **three plots per installation in "reference" oak-dominated habitat**, which we expect will have greater tick abundance relative to the sparseness encountered thus far in the pine dominated habitats.

Allie will do an analysis to see what the tradeoffs are statistically of sampling more burn units (across the range of time since fire) vs. establishing more plots within burn units. Our number of installations to visit is relatively fixed with a goal of at least 12 this season.

- Should we have a minimum number of plots per burn unit area?

- I (Whalen) will pull together some values for the number of burn units at installations and what the range in time-since-fire of those burn units are and send those to Allie.

Here is a map of what one relataively small section of an installation looks like with variable burn unit size. I used this as a guide for our sampling effort. We sampled all of the burn units with a black letter.

# Other needs

## ED2 - Tess & Mike

Tess needs more data on cogongrass:

1. Invasion progression over time, preferably rate of change in density.

    - The Flory Lab has data on progression from the invaded plots in the drought X invasion experiment

2. Estimate of how rhizomes survive fire - recovery following fire. 

    - The Flory Lab is planning to burn the drought X invasion experiment plots this month (planned for Monday, 3/26) and then track recovery of cogongrass (plus a bunch of other measurements)
    
3. Photosynthesis efficiency...some other things forget/missed....

4. Stem density of other herbaceous species in the 1 m quadrats in the field plots (especially when cogongrass is present?)

# Other issues (super ticks)

We're going to work on figuring out the best sticky solution for the tick traps. Brian is planning to come to Florida at the start of the field season in mid-May.
