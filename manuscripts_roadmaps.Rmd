# High Priority

## 1. General Theme: Grass invasion effects on tick survival/abundance & disease risk

Lead by Drew. Main survival analysis by Allie

### Data Included

 - Tick survival experiment (nearly complete)
    - temperature/RH data
    
 - ***in progress*** 2019 paired plots (invaded-uninvaded), tick & host abundance, in progress
    - same data collection as 2017/18 with camera trapping for hosts added
    - ***in progress*** data entry (Steven, Taylor)
    
 - Relative humidity experiment to test tick survival time
    - 85% ("control"), 75%, 65%, 55%, 45%, 35%, 25% 
    - constant temperature 25ÂºC
    - we need to figure out ("hack") preferably small RH chamber setups
 
### Analyses

 - Iterative data summaries as experiment has progressed (Drew, Steven, Whalen)
    - proportional tick survival (I think this becomes the survival analysis results figures)
    - temperature/RH averages & thresholds (Steven)
       - the manuscript figure should illustrate the data/variable(s) used in the model

 - Initial survival analysis done by Allie
    - need to incorporate temperature/RH variable(s)
    - ***in progress*** selection/calculation of these variables 
    - Allie will continue working the survival analysis when we provide "final" data
    - Mike mentioned some modeling being done by a person in his lab
 
 - ***in progress*** downloading and processing camera trap data for host abundance from 2019 field sites (Taylor)
    - How do we summarize these data? (Allie)
    - What measurement units are these - density, use time? (Allie)
 
 - Figure/analysis summarizing tick abundance and host abundance (use?) in cogongrass-invaded vs. uninvaded sites (box-plots)
 
 - Results from relative humidity survival challenge experiment (regression) to support selection of RH threshold values for calculating exposure variables

### Writing

 - Some abstract, intro, and methods (data collection) text has been drafted/outlined (Drew, Whalen, Steven)
 
 - Whalen has been working on revising some and thinking about the angle/context to situate the data/analyses/results. I think choosing an angle to take will benefit greatly from the experience and knowledge of Brian and Allie
 
 - In summary, cogongrass-invasions facilitating longer tick survival may be a cause for concern in terms of disease exposure
    
    - Does potentially more adults feeding at the same time as emerging larvae mean greater possibility of the nymphal-stage becoming infected? Kind of like a "vertical transmission" but not in the true sense of parent directly to offspring, rather indirectly via environmental conditions enhancing adult survival. We have drafted a conceptual figure illustrating this process in terms of disease risk to humans during the tick life-cycle.

## 2. General Theme: Direct and indirect effects of climate and prescribed fire management on tick-borne disease risk

Lead by Whalen

### Data Included

 - 2017 & 2018 data collected across DOD installations
    - vegetation/forest condition
    - tick densities
    - host densities
    - fire history (fire return interval)
    - other forest management activities (***would need to solicit from most installations**)
    - historical climate averages for plots (e.g. PRISM, WorldClim) ***(need to obtain; Tess?)***

    
### Analyses

 - Multivariate regression modeling: develop structural equation model/path analysis that enables evaluating the direct and indirect effects
    - SEM would be rooted in the climate variable(s), temperature/precipitation or some composite of those
    - Base off of structural model in the funded proposal and revise
    - We could compare multiple structural models if there is a potentially biologically reasonable alternative structures
    
 - ***in progress, input from team*** Selecting appropriate model distributions and assumptions (Allie, Mike)
 
 - ***in progress, input from team*** Selecting "best" biological variables for each component model
 
 - Model response variables:
    - Tick densities/abundances
    - Host densities/abundances
    - Forest conditions: trees, ground vegetation, litter, bare ground
    - Fire return interval
    
 - Models would have a random effect for installation and possibly plot levels
 
 
### Writing

None explicitly but I think this would use some from the proposal and the interim report. Whalen would lead.

Compare and contrast the ecological context of results for these forests in the southeast U.S. with results from studies in the midwest, northeast, and west U.S.



## 3. General Theme: Forecasting tick-borne disease risk under future climate and plant (cogongrass) invasion scenarios

This is related to the forecasting/decision-support objective in the proposal - a major requirement of the SERDP contract.

Lead by Tess and Mike.

Tess is thinking two papers, one focused on the ecological forecasting and one on developing and testing management scenarios.

### Data Included

 - All field survey data
 - All data Tess is collecting to "grow" cogongrass in ED2
 - Data from fire experiments involving cogongrass: FABIO, Bivens, Gio's
 - Tick survival experiment
 - Tick humidity threshold experiment
 - Climate change forecasts

Basically all the things

### Analyses

Tess & Mike apply data and results to parameterize the models and develop the decision-support tool.

For forecasting: test multiple invasion and climate scenarios using the relationships established/proven by the structural equation model and discuss the ecological implications

For management: develop a decision support tool to explore how management could change the outcomes of invasion and climate scenarios

 - How can we all contribute in support of their lead efforts?
 
### Writing

None new. Text from the proposal can probably be recycled. 


# Medium Priority

## 1. General Theme: Influence of fire return interval on plant communities in pine forest stands across the southeast U.S.

Without regular fire the communities of upland pine and pine savannahs rapidly disassemble. 

Assessing community disassembly requires some time series, so could be effectively trade space for time from our fire history sampling?

Stress-dominance hypothesis

Fluctuating resource hypothesis

### Data Included

 - vegetation and fire history data from all plots
    - species diversity, evenness, composition, abundance
 
 - soil, topography, climate data

### Analyses

?

### Writing

None. General idea stage



## 2. General Theme: When and where is tick-borne disease risk driven by biotic vs. abiotic conditions?

General idea that Brian brought up during our last meeting as a question in tick ecology that we could contribute to with our data. 

### Data Included

 - Tick and host abundance estimates from our sampling at DOD installations across the southeast
 
 - NEON data from any sites across the U.S. that have collected tick data; do they also collect data to estimate host abundances?
 
 - Any other spatially located available estimates of tick and host abundance that is available
 
 - Climate variables that are limiting to tick and/or host abundances, which could be different depending on geographic location of the data
 
### Writing

None. General idea stage


# Low Priority/Scratched

## General Theme: Effects of an invasive grass on tick-borne pathogens and infection prevalence

This theme could fit in with the manuscript above but would mean waiting for pathogen data from the 2019 tick collections.

### Data Included

 - Pathogens recovered from ticks in cogongrass-invaded and uninvaded plots
    - ***in progress*** most invaded plots will be 2019 data
    
 - Could be limited to 2019 paired plots, but may make sense to leverage all the pathogen data (2017 - 2019) that we generate
    - this could be complicated due to the sampling across fire history
 
 - Host species data to explicitly assess species-specific pathogens
    - e.g. are the ticks "local" or being brought in on larger hosts
    - local ticks = pathogens associated with hosts found in dung surveys/camera traps; otherwise ticks may be arriving on transient hosts with the caveat of detection issues 
 
### Analyses

 - Compare abundance, diversity, composition of pathogen communities from ticks collected in cogongrass-invaded vs. uninvaded areas
 
 - Assess whether any differences in pathogens are related to differencs in host species 
 
 - Leverage survival experiment results for contextualizing impact
 
### Writing

General idea stage. None specifically but this would lean on the manuscript above.



## 7. General Theme: Trap avoidance/escape behavior by the lone star tick in north Florida

A note on the the avoidance and escape ability illustrated by the video we took in 2017. 

### Data Included

Video of tick avoiding going on to tape in the field

### Analyses

Narrative, qualitative.

### Writing

A narrative laying out the conditions in which this occurred.
