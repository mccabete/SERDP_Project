"burn unit" = "burn block" = A discrete area within a larger prescribed or fire use project

(https://www.nwcg.gov/term/glossary/burn-block%C2%A0)

Installations typically have multiple larger management units or trainining areas that are made up of smaller burn units. At some installations the burn units are the same as the training/management areas. There are training and ecological management needs that are considered in the management plan of each area, such as land navigation training for troops and maintaining habitat for species on the federal threatened and endangered species list (e.g. the red cockaded woodpecker). The fire management applied to the burn blocks within the larger areas varies based on the vegetation and the training uses and management goals.

# Technical Approach

## Experimental design (from a statistical perspective): Allie
Our goal was assessing the potential differences in vegetation type and conditions, tick host use, and tick abundances, between congongrass-invaded and uninvaded areas across the range of fire histories at each installation.


## Field sampling design
Following the experimental design, we established plots to achieve a stratified sampling that covered the range of fire history at each installation. We obtained fire history and known cogongrass invasions as GIS layers from each installation and identified potential plot locations based on time since last fire. Potential locations were sent to our contacts at the installation to solicit further guidance on selecting the final set of candidate locations and arranging access. Our sampling season coincided with the prescribed fire management season at most installations, so the fire data we had on hand was sometimes out of date by the time a visit was arranged. In burn blocks with a cogongrass invasion we established one plot in the invaded area and one plot in an univaded area, with at least 100 meters between the plots. In burn blocks without an invasion we established one plot in an area representative of the vegetation conditions in the block.



### Plot design
Each plot consisted of a main circular center plot, a circular subplot, four four 1 m x 1 m qudarats, four 25 cm x 25 cm quadrats, four 50 m transects, and four locations for sampling tick abundance (Figure 1). In the main circular plot (12.6 m radius, approximately 500 m^2^) and subplot (5.64 m radius, approximately 100 m^2^) we measured trees and saplings. Ground vegetation and litter were measured in the 1 m and 25 cm quadrats located 10 m from plot center in each of the cardinal directions. The 50 m transects originated at the plot center going in each cardinal direction and were used to estimate tick-host abundance. Tick abundance sampling locations were placed 8-10 m from the plot center in the NW, NE, SE, and SW areas. The center of each plot was marked with a flag and GPS coordinates were recorded using a Garmin Oregon 650t unit (Olathe, KS).

![Figure 2. Field plot design](figures/plot-design-revised.png)

### Tree and shrub data collection
Within the 12.6 m radius plot we recorded the DBH of all trees ≥ 3 cm DBH to the nearest 0.1 cm, and the distance (nearest 0.1 m) and azimuth (compass degrees) from the plot center to the center of each tree. Each tree was assigned a health category (Table 1) and relative canopy position (Table 2). We recorded the heights of at least 10 trees in the plot (or all trees if fewer than 10) that were representative of each identified canopy position. In the 5.64 m radius subplot we recorded the abundance of woody species (shrubs and tree seedlings/saplings) that were < 3 cm DBH and ≥ 100 cm tall. We also estimated overstory canopy cover for the plot by taking measurements using a spherical convex densiometer (Forestry Suppliers, Jackson, MS) while standing at each 1 m quadrat and facing plot center.


**Table 1.** Tree health categories.
|Health code|Definition|
|-----------|----------|
| 0 | | dead, nothing living |
| 1 | | healthy |
| 2 | | relatively healthy |
| 3 | | unhealthy, barely alive stem |
| 4 | | all stems are dead, but has living sprouts not making DBH |
| 5 | | missing tree, the tree can’t be found during resampling |


**Table 2.** Tree canopy positions.
|Canopy code|Definition|
|-----------|----------|
| U | | Understory, growing beneath the forest canopy, no direct sunlight |
| I | | Intermediate, extend toward the over-story canopy but receive little or no direct sunlight from above and none from the sides |
| C | | Co-dominant, receive direct sunlight from above but limited sunlight from the sides |
| D | | Dominant, extend high into the canopy, sticking out above most other trees, and receive direct sunlight from above and partly on its sides |
| E | | Emergent, crown extends well above all surrounding trees (typically mature redwoods or possibly douglas-fir) |
| S | | Stump, tree no longer has any stems (dead or alive) that make the DBH cutoff, if it does it’s a snag or dead standing stem. If stump present, but also has any stems ≥3cm dbh it is NOT a "stump." Assign canopy class of tallest stem even if it does not make DBH |


### Ground cover and litter data collection
We identified plant species and measured vegetation and litter conditions in each of the four 1 m quadrats. We recorded the percent cover of each plant species, total plant cover, litter cover, and bare ground, and counted the number of stems of each species rooted within the quadrat. Percent cover was visually estimated and estimates were calibrated among observers to ensure consistency. We measured the three tallest heights of woody species and the three tallest heights of non-woody species rooted within each quadrat. Heights were measured from the mineral soil surface. We also made three measurements of litter depth in each quadrat from the top of the litter level to the mineral soil surface. The 25 cm quadrats were placed adjacent to each 1 m quadrat in an area representative of the conditions in the larger qudrat, and we collected vegetation and litter in order to estimate biomass. We collected all above-ground fine vegetation and litter within the 25 cm quadrat into separate bags. Samples were weighed at the end of the day to estimate fresh weights, then were returned to the BARS at UF, placed in a 60ºC drying oven for at least 72 hours, and then weighed to obtain dry weights. The difference between fresh weight and dry weight was used to estimate moisture content.

### Tick sampling
We primarily collected ticks using CO~2~ traps placed in each plot for 24 hours. Tick traps were constructed by mounting 5-quart hard-sided coolers (Igloo, Katy, TX) onto the center of 0.635 cm (0.25 inch) thick plywood pieces cut to 35 cm x 28 cm. There was approximately 7.6 cm between the edge of the plywood and all sides of the cooler. Two 0.48 cm (3/16 inch) holes were drilled through each side of the cooler just above the bottom of the interior. Strips of double-sided carpet tape (DF 545, ShurTape, Hickory, NC) measuring 4.77 cm (1.88 in) wide were attached to the plywood surface surrounding the cooler. Each trap was baited with 1.5 kg of dry ice, which sublimated out through the holes drilled in the coolers. A rain cover made from corrugated plastic roofing cut to cover the entire footprint of the trap was attached to the top of each cooler by drilling a 0.48 cm hole through the center of the cooler lid and securing the roofing using a bolt and a wing-nut.

![Figure 4. Tick trap](pictures/Drew-tick-trap-2017-06-09_09-48-07_256-WD.jpeg)

To ensure collection of ticks attracted by the traps but not stuck to the tape we dragged a 1 m x 1 m cloth across the area directly below each trap three times. Ticks were also collected off of personnel and were assigned a plot, burn unit, or installation depending on the confidence in when the encounter occurred. Ticks collected on traps were counted and removed from the tape using tweezers, placed in vials with 70% ethanol, and transported to the Flory Lab at the University of Florida where they were identified, sorted, and counted by species, life stage, and sex. Sorted ticks were then shipped to the Allan Lab at the University of Illinois where they underwent a second round of identification and sorting, and were subsampled for pathogen analysis (Part 3).


### Estimating host density
We conducted host-dung surveys along each 50 m transect to estimate abundance of tick hosts near the plot area. Observed dung clusters of host species were tallied within 0 to 1 m of the transect line, totaling 400 m^2^ of surveyed area. Species were identified by dung characteristics.

```

We established `r total_plots` total plots at `r num_installations` DoD installations across the southeast US. Fire history varied across the plots, ranging from 0 to `r max_yrs_since_fire` since the last fire. Of the `r total_plots` only `r invaded_plots` were invaded (Figure 5). 


```{r summary of plots visited across installations}

plot_visit_data %>%
       
      group_by(installation_full_name, imcy_inv) %>% 
      summarise(plot_ct = n_distinct(plot_id)) %>% 
      
      ggplot(aes(installation_full_name, plot_ct, label=plot_ct)) +
      geom_col(aes(fill = imcy_inv)) +
