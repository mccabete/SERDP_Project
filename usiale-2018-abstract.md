Abstract (300 word limit)

Tick-borne diseases (TBDs) represent a major public health threat in North America, particularly for military personnel training on Department of Defense (DoD) installations. Ecological theory predicts that climate change will alter vector-borne disease transmission by a variety of direct and indirect pathways. We are exploring several of these pathways, including the interactions among fire regimes, plant invasions, tick-host abundance, and tick abundance, to assess risk of exposure to TBDs on DoD installations across the southeastern U.S. Our focal study species are cogongrass (*Imperata cylindrica*), an exotic invasive plant, and the lone star tick (*Amblyomma americanaum*), which transmits multiple human diseases.

Here, we report on the relationships between fire and cogongrass invasions spanning gradients in fire management and climatic conditions, and the effects of fire and plant community on wildlife-host abundance, tick abundance, and TBD risk to humans. Our overarching hypothesis is that fire and the plant community are the dominant factors affecting the risk of TBD exposure on DoD installations. Results are from the first year of a planned multi-year study, with these data collected primarily from pine-dominated forest landscapes.

We visited six DoD installations, collecting data from 29 plots covering 0-11 years since the last prescribed fire. Management efficacy on DoD installations limited the number of untreated invaded plots to eight plots, and 75% of these were burned less than three years prior. Estimates of tick-host abundance were generally greater 0-1 years, compared to 2+ years, following fire. Tick abundances were greater in uninvaded and less recently burned plots that had higher litter and over-story canopy cover. Climate effects based on the latitudinal gradient of installations werenâ€™t detectable in the current data set. Our initial results provided supporting evidence that fire and the plant community do indeed have dominating effects on TBD risk.
