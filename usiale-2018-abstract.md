Abstract (300 word limit)

Tick-borne diseases (TBDs) represent a major public health threat in North America. Ecological theory predicts that climate change will alter vector-borne disease exposure and transmission through a variety of direct and indirect pathways. We are exploring several of these pathways, along a gradient of climatic conditions on Department of Defense (DoD) installations across the southeastern U.S., including the interactive effects of fire regimes and plant invasions on wildlife-host and tick abundances. Our focal study species are cogongrass (*Imperata cylindrica*), an exotic invasive plant, and the lone star tick (*Amblyomma americanaum*), which transmits multiple human diseases. Our overarching hypothesis is that fire and the plant community are the dominant factors affecting the risk of TBD exposure on DoD installations. Results are from the first year of a planned multi-year study, with these data collected primarily from pine-dominated forest landscapes. Here, we present results from the first year of a planned multi-year study. We visited six DoD installations, collecting data from 29 plots in primarily pine-dominated landscapes varying from 0 to 11 years since the last prescribed fire. Cogongrass management efficacy on DoD installations limited the number of untreated invaded areas to eight plots, with six of these burned less than three years prior. We found that tick-host abundance was greater at 0-1 years than 2+ years, following fire. Tick abundances were greater in uninvaded and less recently burned plots that had higher litter and over-story canopy cover. Climate effects based on the latitudinal gradient of installations werenâ€™t detectable in the current data set. Our initial results provided supporting evidence that fire and the plant community do indeed have dominant effects on TBD risk.
