abstract = {Fire-spread was measured on 121 grass fires in a 2500 ha experimental site in the Northern Territory, Australia. Selected plots were harvested to alter the height, load and bulk density of the fuel-bed. Fires were lit from a line and allowed to travel up to 400 m down- wind. Fire-spread was correlated with fuel, weather and fireshape variables using multiple regression techniques. Wind speed had most effect on fire-spread. The influence of the other variables was examined after a model for wind speed and moisture content had been fitted. Fuel load did not influence fire-spread. Fires in natural swards burnt 18{\%} faster than fires in cut grass, but this increase could not be fully explained by changes in the height or bulk density of the fuel bed. Grass type characterised either by species group or by surface-area- to-volume ratio of the fuel particle, did not appear to significantly icfluence fire-spread. Differences in spread rates between the two grasses were attributed to differ- ences in grass curing. The influence of grass curing appeared to be less than indicated by published models. Models of fire-spread in grasslands currently in use need to be revised. Ignition line length was a significant variable influ- encing fire-spread and this must be taken into consid- eration when using experimental fires to validate theo- retical models or develop empirical models from field observations.},

The fire treatment was applied with an instrument system that allowed precise control over the intensity and duration of fire, and full documentation of the temperatures experienced in various regions of each plant during the fire and postfire cooling phases. A quantitative index of fire exposure, or severity, for each plant was obtained by integrating the temperature curve for the meristematic crown region over the fire and postfire cooling periods. No significant plant mortality was observed at any fire severity level. Although tissue damage in newly initiated culms wasobservedfor Festuca, this didnot significantly affect culm or biomass productivity. Culm production was initiated earlier and more rapidly in Festuca than Agropyron, and within 60 days after fire exposure the total number of culms produced in Festuca was nearly that of unburned plants. Aboveground biomass for both species was significantly less than that of unburned plants at the end of this 60-day period. Agropyron exhibited significantly less culm and biomass production at a moderate fire severity, whereas high fire severity was required for this reduction in Festuca. Contrary to previous studies, Festuca thus appears less sensitive to fire injury than Agropyron},

abstract = {Fire, microhabitat, and their interactions affect Florida scrub ecosystems and their plant species. Concepts of vegetation change in the Florida upland landscape have followed successional theory, with recent models emphasizing the resilience of Florida scrub to fire and the interactive effects of the vegetation and fire regime. We extend these models by incorporating greater complexity in vegetation types and emphasizing that departures from modal fire frequencies may alter vegetation. In particular, fire exclusion leads to structural and compositional changes that, in turn, alter vegetation changes following the reintroduction of fire. Individual species responses to fire can be categorized by the demographic mechanisms of the response (e.g., resprouting, clonal growth, seedling recruitment) and by typical patterns of abundance during fire-free intervals. Various types of scrub differ in these life-history traits. For example, xeric rosemary scrub supports more herbs, more endemics, more specialized species, and more seeders increasing in abundance between fires as compared to less xeric scrubby flatwoods. Several of these species are demonstrated specialists for gaps, which are more abundant and persistent in rosemary scrub than in scrubby flatwoods. In scrubby flatwoods, patterns of species abundance are explainable by time since fire and the presence of gaps, and sprouters are more successful than seeders between fires. In rosemary scrub, where gaps remain long after fire, species abundance patterns reflect only gap abundance, and seeders are especially successful between fires. Because fires create or enlarge gaps that are then closed between fires (especially in less xeric habitats), gap specialists may be sensitive to both fire and microhabitat. Alteration of the modal fire regime is hypothesized to affect the proportion of sprouters and seeders, microsite diversity, and the long-term local persistence of species with different specializations for postfire response and between-fire competitive abilities. Metapopulation dynamics in a landscape patterned by edaphic gradients, a patchy and variable disturbance regime, and small-scale gap dynamics produce varied spatial and temporal patterns in species' abundances.},

abstract = {Frequent fire is an integral component of longleaf pine ecosystems, creating environmental conditions favoring survival and growth of juvenile pines. This study examined stand structure, species composition, and longleaf pine regeneration in an old-growth tract of longleaf pine forest (Boyd Tract) experiencing long-term ({\textgreater}80 yr) fire exclusion in the Sandhills of North Carolina. Sampling of woody stems (i.e., ≥2.5 cm diameter at breast height) and tallies of longleaf pine seedlings were carried out in plots established randomly on upland, mesic areas and lowland, xeric areas within the Boyd Tract. Dominant woody species in mesic plots were black oak, hickories, and large, sparse longleaf pines. Xeric plots had high densities of turkey oak with the large longleaf pines, as well as higher frequencies of smaller longleaf stems. These differences between areas were associated with higher clay content of upland soils and higher sand content of lowland soils. Age-class frequency distributions for fire- suppressed longleaf pine following the last wildfire at the Boyd Tract approximately 80 yr ago contrasted sharply with data from an old-growth longleaf tract in southern Georgia (Wade Tract) that has been under a long-term frequent fire regime. Post-burn recruitment for the Boyd Tract wildfire appears to have been initially high on both site types. Longleaf pine recruitment diminished sharply on the mesic site, but remained high for ∼60 yr on the xeric site. Currently, longleaf pine regeneration is minimal on both site types; several plots contained no seedlings. Sharp contrasts in longleaf pine dominance and stand structure between the Boyd and Wade Tracts demonstrate the importance of large-scale disturbance, especially hurricanes and fire, in shaping the structure and function of longleaf pine ecosystems of the southeastern United States. In particular, long-term exclusion of fire on the Boyd Tract has altered stand structure dramatically by permitting hardwoods to occupy at high densities the characteristically large gaps between longleaf stems that are maintained by fire and other disturbances},

We investigated the effects of two invasive grass species, Imperata cylindrica and Neyraudia reynaudiana, on potential fine fuel loads of south Florida slash pine savannas, which naturally experience frequent fires during the lightning season. Total above-ground biomass of fine fuels and litter biomass were greater in areas where exotic grasses were present than in nearby areas not containing these grasses. In addition, less above-ground biomass of native species was present in areas where N. reynaudiana was present. The increases in both potential total fine fuels and litter suggest that exotic grass invasions can change fire characteristics, even in ecosystems where fires occur very frequently.},

abstract = {A new generation of models of a forest fire is currently being developed; they include more and more physical mechanisms. The main objective of the present study was to provide experimental measurements to test such models. An apparatus was designed to simulate and study in laboratory conditions the flame and the near-field plume stemming from the combustion of an isolated shrub. The burner was made of a cylindrical wire mesh basket filled with a forest fuel ignited at the lower circumference of the basket. Three diameters (20, 28, and 40 cm) for the basket and two kinds of fuel (Pinus pinaster needles and excelsior) were used. Temperatures were measured inside and above the burner using type K thermocouples of 50-$\mu$m diameter. Three pairs of these sensors were especially used to estimate the upward gas velocity, thanks to the expected cross-correlation of thermal fluctuations. We obtained varied and non-steady regimes of combustion as desired, in particular the maximum heat release rates ranged between 30 and 180 kW. The structure of the visible flame and its temperatures were analyzed for a fully developed flame. The height of a flame was found to scale with the heat release rate according to the usual two-fifths power law, which enables a normalized flame height to be defined. Vertical temperature profiles in the flame were found to scale with the normalized height and radial temperature profiles fitted Gaussian laws well. The determination of gas velocity was uncertain, but the usual scaling also applied to the measurements. Scaling rules, which apply well to either steady turbulent diffusion flames on a porous gas burner or pool fires, hold for the non-steady flame on our forest fuel burner, when observing a fully developed flame. {\textcopyright} 2003 The Combustion Institute.

abstract = {Plant invasions are widely recognized as significant threats to biodiversity conservation worldwide. One way invasions can affect native ecosystems is by changing fuel properties, which can in turn affect fire behavior and, ultimately, alter fire regime characteristics such as frequency, intensity, extent, type, and seasonality of fire. If the regime changes subsequently promote the dominance of the invaders, then an invasive plant-fire regime cycle can be established. As more ecosystem components and interactions are altered, restoration of preinvasion conditions becomes more difficult. Restoration may require managing fuel conditions, fire regimes, native plant communities, and other ecosystem properties in addition to the invaders that caused the changes in the first place. We present a multiphase model describing the interrelationships between plant invaders and fire regimes, provide a system for evaluating the relative effects of invaders and prioritizing them for control, and recommend ways to restore preinvasion fire regime properties.},

abstract = {A variety of techniques that estimate temperature and/or heat output during fires are available. We assessed the predictive ability of metal and tile pyrometers, calorimeters of different sizes, and fuel consumption to time-temperature metrics derived from thick and thin thermocouples at 140 points distributed over 9 management-scale burns in a longleaf pine forest in the southeastern US. While all of these devices underestimate maximum flame temperatures, we found several to be useful for characterizing other metrics of fire behavior. While the degree to which thermocouples underestimated maximum temperatures was based on thickness, metrics derived from thermocouple data that integrated time and temperature minimized this discrepancy between thin and thick thermocouples. Thermocouples also provided the most detailed spatial and temporal data of the devices tested. Pyrometers underestimated maximum temperatures relative to thermocouples, but due to their low cost, can be useful for examining spatial variation in temperature during fires. Use of calorimeters is disadvantageous given their lack of precision and high labor cost. Simple fire behavior observations taken during burns and indicators of fire severity observed post-burn were inexpensive to estimate and revealed useful differences among fires. Due to the wide variation among these techniques in cost, labor, accuracy, and level of detail of results, their suitability for a particular project will vary according to research objectives and available resources. Researchers should ensure that the fire behavior parameter measured has a logical relationship to the effect of interest, is measured at an appropriate level of detail, and is reported with attention to the limitations of the measuring devices used.},

Fire has been burning ecosystems for hundreds of millions of years, helping to shape global biome distribution and to maintain the structure and function of fire-prone communities. Fire is also a significant evolutionary force, and is one of the first tools that humans used to re-shape their world. Here, we review the recent literature, drawing parallels between fire and herbivores as alternative consumers of vegetation.

We hypothesized that variation in fire intensity resulting from local differences in fuel loads produces heterogeneity in pine savanna ground cover by altering shrub abundance. To test this hypothesis, we experimentally manipulated prefire fuel loads to mimic naturally occurring fuel-load heterogeneity associated with branch falls, needle fall near large pines, and animal disturbances in a frequently burned longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) savanna in Louisiana, USA. We applied one of four fuel treatments (unaltered control, fine-fuel removal, fine-fuel addition, wood addition) to each of 540 (1-m2) quadrats prior to growing-season prescribed fires in each of two years (1999 and 2001). In both years fuel addition increased (and fuel removal decreased) fuel consumption and maximum fire temperatures relative to unaltered controls. Fuel addition, particularly wood, increased damage to shrubs, increased shrub mortality, and decreased resprout density relative to controls. We propose that local variation in fire intensity may contribute to maintenance of high species diversity in pine savannas by reducing shrub abundance and creating openings in an otherwise continuous ground cover.},

Rather than report device temperatures that are not generally comparable among studies, we show that maximum and time-integrated temperatures of relatively thick (4.8 mm diameter) type-K thermocouple probes (TCPs) can be calibrated to estimate fuel consumption and fire line intensity in surface fires. Although reporting standard fire characteristics is an improvement over reporting device temperatures, TCPs are not ideal instruments for monitoring surface fires, because they provide only point estimates of fire behaviour and must be calibrated for different fire environments, TCP characteristics, and deployments. To illustrate how TCPs respond to fires and to point the way towards a more general calibration method, we report results from a numerical model that accurately simulated TCP response to a spreading surface fire in mixed oak (Quercus spp.) forest litter and woody fuels.},

abstract = {Fire managers often model pine needles as 1 h timelag fuels, but fuelbed properties may significantly change the rate at which needles exchange moisture with the atmosphere. The problem of determining whether moisture loss from fine fuels is being controlled by individual particles or by the fuelbed remains unresolved. Results from this laboratory experiment indicate that first-period timelags of longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) needles are altered by fuelbed loading and needle arrangement. Timelags of individual needles ranged from 3.3 to 5.3 h; timelags of beds of vertically oriented needles (4.4 to 8.6 h) approximated those of individual particles, but were slightly influenced by loading. Beds of horizontal needles dried with load-dependent timelags that varied from 6.5 to 31.6 h. Fuel loads ranged from 0.04 (for individual particles) to 1.07 kg{\textperiodcentered}m-2. We report a new metric, the area drying rate, which is analogous to a unit-area burning rate. For beds of flat needles, plots of the area drying rate versus fuel load illustrate a transition from control by individual particles to control by the bed structure when fuel loading is approximately 0.33 kg{\textperiodcentered}m-2. Beds of vertical needles were particle controlled. Results should be useful to fire managers when modeling fire behavior. {\textcopyright} 2008 NRC.},

abstract = {In ecosystems with frequent surface fire regimes, fire and fuel heterogeneity has been largely overlooked owing to the lack of unburned patches and the difficulty in measuring fire behavior at fine scales (0.1{\^{a}}€“10 m). The diverse vegetation in these ecosystems varies at these fine scales. This diversity could be driven by the influences of local interactions among patches of understorey vegetation and canopy-supplied fine fuels on fire behavior, yet no method we know of can capture fine-scale fuel and fire measurements such that these relationships could be rigorously tested. We present here an original method for inventorying of fine-scale fuels and in situ measures of fire intensity within longleaf pine forests of the south-eastern USA. Using ground-based LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) with traditional fuel inventory approaches, we characterized within-fuel bed variation into discrete patches, termed wildland fuel cells, which had distinct fuel composition, characteristics, and architecture that became spatially independent beyond 0.5 m2. Spatially explicit fire behavior was measured in situ through digital infrared thermography. We found that fire temperatures and residence times varied at similar scales to those observed for wildland fuel cells. The wildland fuels cell concept could seamlessly connect empirical studies with numerical models or cellular automata models of fire behavior, representing a promising means to better predict within-burn heterogeneity and fire effects.},

abstract = {Several recent papers have suggested replacing the terminology of fire intensity and fire severity. Part of the problem with fire intensity is that it is sometimes used incorrectly to describe fire effects, when in fact it is justifiably restricted to measures of energy output. Increasingly, the term has created confusion because some authors have restricted its usage to a single measure of energy output referred to as fireline intensity. This metric is most useful in understanding fire behavior in forests, but is too narrow to fully capture the multitude of ways fire energy affects ecosystems. Fire intensity represents the energy released during various phases of a fire, and different metrics such as reaction intensity, fireline intensity, temperature, heating duration and radiant energy are useful for different purposes. Fire severity, and the related term burn severity, have created considerable confusion because of recent changes in their usage. Some authors have justified this by contending that fire severity is defined broadly as ecosystem impacts from fire and thus is open to individual interpretation. However, empirical studies have defined fire severity operationally as the loss of or change in organic matter aboveground and belowground, although the precise metric varies with management needs. Confusion arises because fire or burn severity is sometimes defined so that it also includes ecosystem responses. Ecosystem responses include soil erosion, vegetation regeneration, restoration of community structure, faunal recolonization, and a plethora of related response variables. Although some ecosystem responses are correlated with measures of fire or burn severity, many important ecosystem processes have either not been demonstrated to be predicted by severity indices or have been shown in some vegetation types to be unrelated to severity. This is a critical issue because fire or burn severity are readily measurable parameters, both on the ground and with remote sensing, yet ecosystem responses are of most interest to resource managers.},

abstract = {Knowing how species respond to fire regimes is essential for ecologically sustainable management. This axiom raises two important questions: (1) what knowledge is the most important to develop and (2) to what extent can current research methods deliver that knowledge? We identify three areas of required knowledge: (i) a mechanistic understanding of species' responses to fire regimes; (ii) knowledge of how the spatial and temporal arrangement of fires influences the biota; and (iii) an understanding of interactions of fire regimes with other processes. We review the capacity of empirical research to address these knowledge gaps, and reveal many limitations. Manipulative experiments are limited by the number and scope of treatments that can be applied, natural experiments are limited by treatment availability and confounding factors, and longitudinal studies are difficult to maintain, particularly due to unplanned disturbance events. Simulation modelling is limited by the quality of the underlying empirical data and by uncertainty in how well model structure represents reality. Due to the constraints on large-scale, long-term research, the potential for management experiments to inform adaptive management is limited. Rather than simply recommending adaptive management, we define a research agenda to maximise the rate of learning in this difficult field. This includes measuring responses at a species level, building capacity to implement natural experiments, undertaking simulation modelling, and judicious application of experimental approaches. Developing ecologically sustainable fire management practices will require sustained research effort and a sophisticated research agenda based on carefully targeting appropriate methods to address critical management questions. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Fire ecology has been hindered by the lack of comparable, affordable protocols to quantify the flammability of whole plants over large numbers of species.We describe a low-tech device that can be carried to the field and that allows highly standardized measurement of the flammability of whole individuals or portions up to 70 cm long.We illustrate its potential with results for 34 species belonging to different growth forms from central Argentina. The device consists of an 85 ¥ 60 cm half-cut metallic barrel placed horizontally and mounted on a removable metallic structure. It contains three parallel burners, a grill with an attached gauging thermometer and a blowtorch. Burners and blowtorch are connected to a propane–butane gas cylinder. Plant samples are placed on the grill and preheated with the burners for 2 min at 150°C.They are then ignited for 10 s with the blowtorch while the burners are kept on. Four parameters are measured for each sample: maximum temperature reached, burning time, burnt length and burnt biomass percentage. These parameters are used to construct a compound index of flammability for each sample that ranges between 0 (no flammability) and around 3 (maximum flammability).We obtained a wide range of values for flammability and all its components. Most of this variability was accounted for by differences between growth forms and species, rather than by differences at the level of replicates.This suggests that the device and protocol are sensitive enough to detect flammability differences among plants with different functional traits, and at the same time robust enough to produce consistent results among samples with similar traits. A major advantage is that plant architecture is kept almost intact, providing a flammability measure much closer to that of whole individuals in the field than those obtained by other standard protocols in use.The device and protocol presented here should facilitate the acquisition of comparable flammability data over large numbers of species from different floras and ecosystems, potentially contributing to several fields of research, such as functional ecology, evolutionary ecology and vegetation-atmosphere modelling.

abstract = {The frequent fires typical of the longleaf pine ecosystem in the south-eastern USA are carried by live understorey vegetation and pine litter. Mature longleaf pine stands in the xeric sandhills region have a variable understorey vegetation layer, creating several fuel complexes at the within-stand scale (20 m2). We identified three fuel complexes found in frequently burned stands on the Carolina Sandhills National Wildlife Refuge, and used prescribed fire to test whether distinct sets of fire conditions were associated with each fuel complex. Study plots were dominated by either turkey oak or wiregrass in the understorey, or lacked understorey vegetation and contained only longleaf pine litter. Turkey oak-dominated plots had the highest fuel loads, and during burns they had higher total net heat flux than wiregrass- or longleaf pine litter-dominated plots, and longer burn durations than wiregrass-dominated plots. Across all plots, the quantity of litter fragments had the greatest effect on fire temperature and duration of burn. These results show that the patchy understorey vegetation within longleaf pine stands will create heterogeneous fires, and areas dominated by turkey oak may have increased fire intensity and soil heating compared with the other two fuel complexes.},

Understanding flammability changes after treatments is crucial for the sustainable use of fire. The objectives of this study were to evaluate (1) any differences in the flammability of gorse plant parts 1 and 5 years after burning and (2) the flammability of whole plants, assessing complementarities of the results between full-scale and bench-scale tests. Results showed the importance of the effect of the different scales and types of methods used to determine the four components of flammability of forest fuels: (1) Ignitability was highly dependent on the type of ignition source. (2) Combustibility was more dependent on the dead fraction than on live plant part characteristics. (3) Sustainability was mainly related to physical characteristics, like air flow interaction with fuel compactness. (4) Consumability, in terms of residual mass fraction, was similar at both scales. The results suggest the need for intensive management of gorse shrubland to maintain them at a very young age in order to reduce flammability associated with the rapid physiological and structural changes in this kind of vegetation.},

Flammable needles of longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) potentially increase maximum fire temperatures and durations of heating, negatively affecting other trees within the groundcover. Less flammable leaves that accumulate around the bases of understorey stems of hardwood trees such as mockernut hickories (Carya alba) in the fall potentially depress maximum fire temperatures and durations of heating, enhancing post-fire recovery. * We experimentally manipulated amounts of pine and hickory leaves beneath understorey hickory stems in a pine savanna, measured temperatures during prescribed fires and assessed combustion of fuels and survival and regrowth of hickory stems. * Pine needles increased fire temperatures and durations of heating relative to herbaceous fuels and increased combustion of hickory leaves. Hickory leaves, however, neither increased nor decreased fire characteristics relative to herbaceous fuels. * All hickories survived fire by resprouting. When pine needles were absent, most hickories resprouted from buds located above-ground along the stem at heights inversely related to temperature increase. In contrast, resprouting occurred only from underground root crowns when pine needles were present. Such differences in locations of resprouts influenced sizes of stems at the end of the growing season. * Synthesis. Groundcover fuels containing flammable leaves shed by pyrogenic species of savanna trees affect local fire characteristics and resprouting of non-pyrogenic understorey trees.

abstract = {Non-native, invasive grasses have been linked to altered grass-fire cycles worldwide. Although a few studies have quantified resulting changes in fire activity at local scales, and many have speculated about larger scales, regional alterations to fire regimes remain poorly documented. We assessed the influence of large-scale Bromus tectorum (hereafter cheatgrass) invasion on fire size, duration, spread rate, and interannual variability in comparison to other prominent land cover classes across the Great Basin, USA. We compared regional land cover maps to burned area measured using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for 2000-2009 and to fire extents recorded by the USGS registry of fires from 1980 to 2009. Cheatgrass dominates at least 6{\%} of the central Great Basin (650 000 km(2) ). MODIS records show that 13{\%} of these cheatgrass-dominated lands burned, resulting in a fire return interval of 78 years for any given location within cheatgrass. This proportion was more than double the amount burned across all other vegetation types (range: 0.5-6{\%} burned). During the 1990s, this difference was even more extreme, with cheatgrass burning nearly four times more frequently than any native vegetation type (16{\%} of cheatgrass burned compared to 1-5{\%} of native vegetation). Cheatgrass was also disproportionately represented in the largest fires, comprising 24{\%} of the land area of the 50 largest fires recorded by MODIS during the 2000s. Furthermore, multi-date fires that burned across multiple vegetation types were significantly more likely to have started in cheatgrass. Finally, cheatgrass fires showed a strong interannual response to wet years, a trend only weakly observed in native vegetation types. These results demonstrate that cheatgrass invasion has substantially altered the regional fire regime. Although this result has been suspected by managers for decades, this study is the first to document recent cheatgrass-driven fire regimes at a regional scale.},

abstract = {Fire seasonality, an important characteristic of fire regimes, commonly is delineated using seasons based on single weather variables (rainfall or temperature). We used nonparametric cluster analyses of a 17-year (1993-2009) data set of weather variables that influence likelihoods and spread of fires (relative humidity, air temperature, solar radiation, wind speed, soil moisture) to explore seasonality of fire in pine savanna-grassland landscapes at the Avon Park Air Force Range in southern Florida. A four-variable, three-season model explained more variation within fire weather variables than models with more seasons. The three-season model also delineated intra-annual timing of fire more accurately than a conventional rainfall-based two-season model. Two seasons coincided roughly with dry and wet seasons based on rainfall. The third season, which we labeled the fire season, occurred between dry and wet seasons and was characterized by fire-promoting conditions present annually: drought, intense solar radiation, low humidity, and warm air temperatures. Fine fuels consisting of variable combinations of pyrogenic pine needles, abundant C4 grasses, and flammable shrubs, coupled with low soil moisture, and lightning ignitions early in the fire season facilitate natural landscape-scale wildfires that burn uplands and across wetlands. We related our three season model to fires with different ignition sources (lightning, military missions, and prescribed fires) over a 13-year period with fire records (1997-2009). Largest wildfires originate from lightning and military ignitions that occur within the early fire season substantially prior to the peak of lightning strikes in the wet season. Prescribed ignitions, in contrast, largely occur outside the fire season. Our delineation of a pronounced fire season provides insight into the extent to which different human-derived fire regimes mimic lightning fire regimes. Delineation of a fire season associated with timing of natural lightning ignitions should be useful as a basis for ecological fire management of humid savanna-grassland landscapes worldwide.},

Because of the slope and the size of the fuel bed, the mass loss rate and the heat release rate do not reach a quasi-steady state when the propagation takes place under slope condition. This is due to a V-shape distortion of the fire front, which leads to an increase of the burnt surface rate by the fire over time. The study of this quantity has shown that the heat release over time can be estimated with the fuel load and the time derivative of the burnt surface. The fractions of radiation and convection released by the fire in its environment were calculated. Under a slope of 20°, the convective fraction decreases from 74.9{\%} to 61.1{\%} whereas the overall radiant fraction ranges between 25.1{\%} and 38.9{\%} and increases with increasing fuel loads.},

abstract = {Adaptive management methods are best for ensuring management goals are met when implementing prescribed fire to areas of fire exclusion. Prior to intense logging and subsequent fire suppression efforts of the early 1900s, longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) woodlands dominated the southeastern United States. As a pyrogenic forest type, natural wildfires occur with a 2-15year fire return interval. Remaining longleaf forests are predominantly second-growth, with current vegetation structure reflecting decades of fire exclusion resulting from continued suppression efforts. Research in longleaf savannas has demonstrated that hardwood encroachment, reduced floristic diversity, and reduced longleaf yearling establishment occurs in the absence of fire. However, few studies have examined the potential role of prescribed fire management in moderating longleaf pine regeneration in second-growth xeric sandhill assemblages. Over a seven year period of fire reintroduction, we examined the effects of prescribed fire on longleaf pine demographics and structure in a forest that experienced a significant reduction in fire frequency during the 20th century. We observed no difference in overstory composition or hardwood density between burned and adjacent unburned areas. Understory woody stem density (DBH{\textless}2cm) was dominated by juvenile longleaf plants, which likely caused greater variability in light reaching the forest floor in unburned vs. burned areas. Significant shifts in demographic structure were evident in juvenile longleaf plants that initiated height growth following the onset of prescribed fire treatments. Longleaf yearling density ({\textless}1year old) averaged 5plantsm-2 (unburned {\textless}1plantm-2) and was positively correlated with fire frequency. Greater accumulation of leaf litter in unburned (10cm) vs. burned areas (5cm) likely influenced yearling recruitment, as expected given the species' need for contact with bare mineral soil for germination. Unlike pine savannas where reduction of hardwoods is often the target of management, intraspecific interactions (i.e. negative density dependence) likely play a greater role in successful longleaf recruitment and population demography in this sandhill assemblage. This study further highlights the utility of implementing and observing a range of fire applications when reintroducing fire to long unburned systems.},

abstract = {While many ecosystems depend on fire to maintain biodiversity, non-native plant invasions can enhance fire intensity, suppressing native species and generating a fire-invasion feedback. These dynamics have been observed in arid and semi-arid ecosystems, but fire-invasion interactions in temperate deciduous forests, where prescribed fires are often used as management tools to enhance native diversity, have rarely been investigated., Here we evaluated the effects of a widespread invasive grass on fire behaviour in eastern deciduous forests in the USA and the potential effects of fire and invasions on tree regeneration. We planted native trees into invaded and uninvaded forests, quantified fuel loads, then applied landscape-scale prescribed fires and no-burn controls, and measured fire behaviour and tree seedling and invasive plant performance., Our results show that fires in invaded habitats were significantly more intense, including higher fire temperatures, longer duration and higher flame heights, even though invasions did not alter total fuel loads. The invasion plus fire treatment suppressed native tree seedling survival by 54{\%} compared to invasions without fire, and invasions reduced natural tree recruitment by 66{\%}., We also show that invasive plant biomass did not change from one season to the next in plots where fire was applied, but invader biomass declined significantly in unburned reference plots, suggesting a positive invasive grass-fire feedback., Synthesis and applications. These findings demonstrate that fire-invasion interactions can have significant consequences for invaded temperate forest ecosystems by increasing fire intensity and reducing tree establishment while promoting invasive plant persistence. To encourage tree regeneration and slow invasive spread, we recommend that forest managers remove invasions prior to applying prescribed fires or avoid the use of fire in habitats invaded by non-native grasses.},

abstract = {Non-native grass invasions have the potential to change natural and prescribed fire regimes by altering fuels, which in turn may promote further invasion. We examined if invasion by Microstegium vimineum, a non-native annual grass, resulted in a positive invasion-fire feedback in eastern deciduous forests managed with prescribed fire and how this response varied across the landscape. Using paired invaded and uninvaded plots embedded in forest stands subjected to prescribed fire, we quantified differences in fire intensity and fuel loads, and fire effects on M. vimineum seedbank emergence, performance and spread. Invaded sites had less leaf litter and fine woody fuels, and increased fire intensity. Although fire reduced emergence of M. vimineum from the soil seedbank, sites subjected to prescribed fire had greater M. vimineum biomass and higher recruitment than unburned sites. Soil moisture strongly modulated M. vimineum response to fire, such that fire facilitated M. vimineum invasion more in wetter than drier sites. These findings indicate that deciduous forests are vulnerable to positive invasion-fire feedbacks, although the positive effect of fire may be less pronounced where soil moisture is limiting. The interaction between soil moisture and fire effects can inform management decisions regarding where to combine prescribed burning with intensive invasive control measures such as torching, hand pulling, and herbicide application.},

abstract = {Prescribed fire is widely used to manage fuels in high-frequency, low-severity fire regimes including pine flatwoods of the southeastern USA where prescribed burning during the growing season (the frost-free period during the calendar year) has become more common in recent decades. Growing season prescribed fires address ecological management objectives that focus on increasing herb cover and decreasing shrub cover. The shift from shrub to herb dominance due to burning in the growing season corresponds to a change in surface fuels that could affect fire behavior, yet little has been done to assess the potential effects. We examined the effects of season-of-burn on shrub and herbaceous fuel layers and predicted fire behavior at replicate plots on frequently burned mesic pine flatwoods for two season-of-burn treatments (growing and dormant season prescribed fires) in two geographic regions in northern Florida. The Fuel Characteristic Classification System was used to construct a representative fuelbed for each plot at each sampling time to predict fire behavior. Predicted fire behavior was tested for correlation with measured surface fuel properties to determine if there was an effect from differences in fuels characteristics across treatments. In addition, fire temperature was measured in situ as a proxy for fire intensity and tested for treatment effects on the re-growth of live surface fuels. Compared to single dormant season burns, our single growing season burns caused no changes to live understory fuels and had no detectable effect on fire behavior, although predicted rate of spread and flame length were significantly reduced after all prescribed burns. Shrub cover and predicted fire behavior were, however, significantly different between geographic regions, and shrub height was significantly affected by fire temperature. Predicted fire behavior was strongly correlated with measures of the litter and herb strata. Results from this study suggest that land managers should not initially expect large changes in understory fuel properties or potential fire behavior from a shift to burning during the growing season and show that geographic location and fire intensity had significant effects on live fuels and potential fire behavior.},

abstract = {Fire is an important ecological disturbance in vegetated ecosystems across the globe, and also has considerable impacts on human infrastructure. Vegetation flammability is a key bottom-up control on fire regimes and on the nature of individual fires. Although New Zealand (NZ) historically had low fire frequencies, anthropogenic fires have considerably impacted indigenous vegetation as humans used fire extensively to clear forests. Few studies of vegetation flammability have been undertaken in NZ and only one has compared the flammability of indigenous plants; this was a qualitative assessment derived from expert opinion. We addressed this knowledge gap by measuring the flammability of terminal shoots from a range of trees and shrubs found in NZ. We quantified shoot flammability of 60 indigenous and exotic species, and compared our experimentally derived ranking with expert opinion. The most flammable species was the invasive exotic shrub Gorse (Ulex europaeus), followed by Manna Gum (Eucalyptus viminalis), K (u) over bar marahou (Pomaderris kumeraho), Rimu (Dacrydium cupressinum) and Silver Beech (Lophozonia menziesii). Our experimentally derived ranking was strongly correlated with expert opinion, lending support to both methods. Our results are useful to ecologists seeking to understand how fires have and will influence NZ's ecosystems, and for fire managers identifying high-risk landscapes, and low flammability species for green firebreaks'.},

abstract = {Tropical grasses fuel the majority of fires on Earth. In fire-prone landscapes, enhanced flammability may be adaptive for grasses via the maintenance of an open canopy and an increase in spatiotemporal opportunities for recruitment and regeneration. In addition, by burning intensely but briefly, high flammability may protect resprouting buds from lethal temperatures. Despite these potential benefits of high flammability to fire-prone grasses, variation in flammability among grass species, and how trait differences underpin this variation, remains unknown. By burning leaves and plant parts, we experimentally determined how five plant traits (biomass quantity, biomass density, biomass moisture content, leaf surface-area-to-volume ratio and leaf effective heat of combustion) combined to determine the three components of flammability (ignitability, sustainability and combustibility) at the leaf and plant scales in 25 grass species of fire-prone South African grasslands at a time of peak fire occurrence. The influence of evolutionary history on flammability was assessed based on a phylogeny built here for the study species. Grass species differed significantly in all components of flammability. Accounting for evolutionary history helped to explain patterns in leaf-scale combustibility and sustainability. The five measured plant traits predicted components of flammability, particularly leaf ignitability and plant combustibility in which 70{\%} and 58{\%} of variation, respectively, could be explained by a combination of the traits. Total above-ground biomass was a key driver of combustibility and sustainability with high biomass species burning more intensely and for longer, and producing the highest predicted fire spread rates. Moisture content was the main influence on ignitability, where species with higher moisture contents took longer to ignite and once alight burnt at a slower rate. Biomass density, leaf surface-area-to-volume ratio and leaf effective heat of combustion were weaker predictors of flammability components. Synthesis. We demonstrate that grass flammability is predicted from easily measurable plant functional traits and is influenced by evolutionary history with some components showing phylogenetic signal. Grasses are not homogenous fuels to fire. Rather, species differ in functional traits that in turn demonstrably influence flammability. This diversity is consistent with the idea that flammability may be an adaptive trait for grasses of fire-prone ecosystems.},

abstract = {Fire is integral to the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems of the southeastern USA and is a strong selective force on plant species. Among woody plants, oak species (Quercus spp. L) have diverse life history traits that appear to reflect their evolution in this fire-prone region. Oaks also occur across wide gradients of fire frequency and intensity, from annually burned savannas to fire-protected forests. As such, oak functional traits are presumed to reflect adaptations to acquire limited resources (i.e., “physiological traits”) or survive environmental stress (i.e., “protective traits”). Oak functional traits may also influence fire regimes (i.e., via “flammability traits”) by altering fire behavior through effects on fuels and their combustion. We synthesized evidence from ecophysiological measurements, laboratory burning and drying experiments, and field experiments to determine the suites of functional traits that reflect fire adaptive strategies in eight Southeastern oaks for which abundant data were available. We found strong correlations among Principal Components Analysis axes for flammability (litter burning and drying), protective (bark and wound responses), and physiological (growth) traits. The eight oaks clustered into three strategies: 1) pyrophytic species that produce highly flammable leaf litter, accrue thick bark rapidly, close wounds rapidly, and grow slowly; 2) mesophytic species that produce low flammability litter, have thin bark, and are fast growing; and 3) fire-avoider species with a mixture of traits from the two extremes. This synthesis clarifies the relative pyrophily of Southeastern oaks and suggests how suites of fire-related traits influence fire regimes and species habitat preferences.},

abstract = {Frequently burned low-latitude coniferous forests maintain a high-diversity understory. Longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) forests and woodlands have exceptionally high diversity at fine scales and very frequent fire return intervals (1–3 yr). Furthermore, the positive association between high-frequency, low-intensity surface fires and high species richness in longleaf pine ecosystems is well documented but poorly understood. Recent studies have demonstrated additional linkages between specific fuel assemblages and fire intensity at small spatial scales. In this study, we build upon both patterns by using long-term datasets to examine the relationship between fire and specific fuel types, and how the combination of these two elements contributes to ground cover species diversity. We used 11 yr of monitoring data from longleaf pine forests at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida (USA), to parameterize a structural equation model that examines causal relationships between fuels and fire history on ground cover plant diversity. Overstory-derived fuels, including pine needle litter, pine cones, and other 10 and 100-h woody fuels, had the greatest positive impact on diversity in relatively open-canopied, frequently burned reference stands. A second model examined surface fuel components originating from the forest overstory as characterized by airborne light detection and ranging and found that pine needle litter was positively associated with canopy density. Our parameter estimates for causal relationships between easily measured variables and plant diversity will allow for the development of management models at the stand scale while being informed by fuels measured at the plot scale.},

Callitris intratropica is a fire-sensitive conifer that is widespread across northern Australia, but its range is contracting because of frequent and intense fires. * A small-scale field experiment was used to compare the effect of three fuel types (grass, eucalypt litter and C. intratropica litter), and a mix of grass and eucalypt litter by varying fuel loads within their naturally occurring bounds, and measuring multiple flammability attributes. * Fuel type had the strongest influence on flammability attributes and hence sapling survival. Grass burnt rapidly, producing high temperatures, while duration of flaming was longer for eucalypt litter. Grass–eucalypt litter mixtures had flammability attributes more like grass, while C. intratropica litter was difficult to burn. Fuel load had a secondary effect, with strong interactions between fuel type and load. * Differences in sapling survival could be attributed to temperatures at 5 cm height; there was no additional effect of fuel type or canopy temperature. Sapling size variables were also important, and strongly correlated with bark thickness, so we could not identify the protective mechanism. * Synthesis. Mortality of Callitris intratropica saplings was consistent with damage to the lower stem, because of the direct relationship with temperatures at 5 cm height. Our results demonstrate the existence of a grass–fire cycle in C. intratropica stands, whereby hot fires damage the stands and allow grass to invade, increasing the stand ignitability and combustibility and promoting further fires. Interrupting this cycle by reducing grass fuel loads and hence the frequency of hot fires should therefore be a management priority to safeguard C. intratropica populations. Our findings also highlight that, under a common climate, vegetation type can shape fire regimes, because fuel type strongly influences flammability attributes, which in turn act as a powerful filter of plant populations.},
