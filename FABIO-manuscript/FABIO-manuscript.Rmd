# INTRODUCTION

Fine surface fuels play a major role in the ignition, spread, and intensity of fires. Fire behavior from ~1-m^2^ to landscape (hectares) scales is driven by weather conditions and fuel characteristics, including fuel load, structure, moisture, and continuity. Understanding how fuel characteristics influence fire intensity, severity, and behavior is imperative for fire ecologists, modelers, and land managers where fire is an integral part of the landscape. However, specific information is know about relatively few species, and while valuable, this information is often obtained by studies conducted across a spectrum of realism. Methods range from *in situ* approaches where measurements are made before, during, and after prescribed fires (high realism, low replication), to laboratory bench approaches where small amounts of fuel are combusted in highly controlled settings (low realism, highly replicable) EXPAND ON GAPS & REALISM/REPLICATION TRADEOFF (@Fernandes2012).

Fire ecology experiments in the field often only manipulate the fuel load or type, necessarily sacrificing some realism in fuel structure. Fuels are often piled horizontally even though fuel complexes are typically more heterogeneous with subtantial vertical structure that affects fire behavior (@Loudermilk2014). For example, in a grass-savanna landscape @Bowman2017 piled fuels horizontally for a field experiment examining how fine fuel loads of different types affected fire intensity and survival of tree saplings. They found that sapling mortality increased with fire intensity (maximum temperature at 5 cm). Fire intensity increased with fuel load, and grass-only and grass-litter fuel complexes produced greater fire intensities than litter-only fuels. Similarly, @Thaxton2006 altered fuel loads in a longleaf pine system to examine groundcover shrub survival. They added fixed amounts of fuel by piling either longleaf pine needles or pieces of pine wood, or removing a fixed amount of fine fuels from plots. The fuel addition treatments resulted in greater fire temperatures and shrub mortality compared to the removal and control treatments. 

Each of these studies provide useful information that is applicable to the conditions of their study area and for the scale of the question, however, they also necessarily sacrifice some realism in fuel structure.  

@JAUREGUIBERRY2011, @Simpson2016, @Wyse2016

In this paper we present an experimental apparatus that can bridge the gap between making measurements of flammability at the lab bench and the limited replication of prescribed fires. The Fine Aboveground Biomass Incineration Organizer (FABIO) enables experimental manipulation of fuel load and structure at a realtively small but realistic and relevant scale of 1-m^2^. We expect our design will be most useful for grasses or grass-like fuels, but it could be used or adapted for other fuel types such as small shrubs and trees. 


Fuel load has been shown to be a particularly important driver of combustibility, sustainability, and rate of spread. 

Temperature metrics are influenced by fuel structure. In general, fuels with greater vertical arrangement will achieve higher maximum temperatures, but will also burn faster. Faster burning should result in less exposure to temperatures that cause plant tissue damage. We show these differences in maximum temperature and time above 100 ºC for standing and piled fuels.

Also, density, dead:live ratio - the more flammable dead fuels can disproportionately influence fire behavior.

Grasses in particular fuel lots of fires, fuel loads are often increased in landscapes invaded by non-native grasses.  

We present a methodology for maintaining realism in fuel structure in experiments where fine fuels with typical vertical structure, e.g. grasses, are manipulated.

Using the exotic invasive cogongrass we illustrate how changing the fuel structure can substantially alter flammability characteristics. 

It can be deployed in the field or in a more controlled "laboratory" setting. 




# METHODS

## Study site
We harvested ~50 kg of standing cogongrass from an invasion at the Biven's Arm Research Station (BARS), Florida, USA. The fuel was stored in a shed for 48-hours to protect it from rainfall, and then spread outside in a cleared area to dry for ~72 hours. We raked through the pile each day to increase drying, while carefully maintaining stem orientation in the same direction. We found that consistent stem orientation was more efficient for weighing and loading fuels vertically into the FABIO.

### Fine Aboveground Biomass Incineration Organizer (FABIO)

## Data collection and analysis

Our experimental design was to conduct six burns, three piled and three standing, for each of five fuel loads (250 g, 500 g, 1000 g, 1500 g, 2000 g) spanning the range of cogongrass biomass observed from field measurements across Florida, USA. 

Thermocouple sensor specs
Thermocouple logger specs

Weather data was recorded at a two second interval during fires using a Kestrel 5500 Fire Weather Pro pocket weather tracker (Nielsen-Kellerman, Boothwyn, PA) mounted on a tripod to be ~1 m above the ground.

We used linear regression to model the average maximum temperature and time above 100 ºC at each probe height, and the average flame height, rate of spread, and percent consumed from each fire. Fuel load (mass) and fuel structure (piled vs. standing) were used as explanatory variables, with fuel load treated as continuous. We tested the main effects and interaction of these variables. If the interaction did not have a strong effect we fit a new model with only main effects. We report results from models that

We applied a linear model where

$$
y_{i} = \alpha + \beta_{1}*biomass_{i} + \beta_{2}*biomass_{i}*structure_{i}

### Linear models of maximum temperature
The "maximum temperature" at each height is the average of the maximum temperatures from the three temperature probes located at that height. For some of the fires with the lowest amount of biomass (250 g) the probe temperature did not deviate from near-ambient (Fig. 3).

We used the statistical language `R` `r citep(citation())` for all our analyses. These were implemented in dynamic rmarkdown documents using `knitr` `r citep(citation("knitr"))` and `rmarkdown` `r citep(citation("rmarkdown"))` packages. All the multilevel models were fitted with `lme4` `r citep(citation("lme4"))`. 



# RESULTS

Trees in forest A grew taller than those in forest B (mean height: `r mean(25, 31, 28)` versus `r mean(13, 19, 16)` m). And many more cool results that get updated dynamically.

## Key experimental fire ecology studies for reference

[@Bowman2017] *Differential demographic filtering by surface fires: How fuel type and fuel load affect sapling mortality of an obligate seeder savanna tree.*

In this study, "Grass fuels had to be laid horizontally rather than standing vertically." The context provided is that the native sorghum grass flattens easily after it dries and does not remain vertical throughout the dry season. 

- This reads like a response to a reviewer comment, which might indicate a gap that the FABIO methodology can fill. 

- Average flame height was measured "when the fire was within 15cm of the tree stem using a metal grid placed verically against a steel picket placed next to the stem."


Additional references given where fuels have been laid flat when testing flammability:

 - **`r citep("Jaureguiberry 2011 Austral Ecology")`**

      - Built the "Bar-B-Q"" apparatus to fill a need to quantify flammability of whole plants of many species
    
      - Quantified flammability characteristics of 34 species using "whole plant"
    
      - Fuels are still burnt horizontally, so no vertical structure
    
      - Length of fuel limited by size of burning surface


 - **[@Simpson2016]**
 
      - Assessed flammability of 25 savanna grass species
      
      - five plant traits: biomass quantity, biomass density, biomass moisture content, leaf surface-area:volume ratio, leaf effective heat combustion
      
      - related plant traits to three components of flammability: ignitability, sustainability, combustibility at leaf and plant scales
      
      - Results: total above-ground biomass drove combustibility and sustainability - high biomass was more intense for longer; moisture content was main driver of ignitability and also reduced combustion rate; estimates of whole-plant combustion rates showed >20-fold variation; Showed that there was significant variation between species in flammability at the plant-level and leaf-level
 

 - **[@Wyse2016]**

*All of these studies assessed flammability of multiple species, or multiple fuel complexes.*
