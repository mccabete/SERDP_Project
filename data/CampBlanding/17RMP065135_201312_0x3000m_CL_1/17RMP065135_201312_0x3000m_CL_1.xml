      <abstract>"RGB 1.0 ft digital orthophotos covering Clay County, Florida" An orthoimage is remotely sensed image data in which displacement of features in the image caused by terrain relief and sensor orientation have been mathematically removed. Orthoimagery combines the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map.  There is no image overlap between adjacent files.
Data received at Earth Resources Observation and Science Center (EROS) were reprojected from:
Projection:  NAD_1983_StatePlane_Florida_East_FIPS_0901_Feet
Resolution:  1 foot
Type:  Natural Color
to:
Standard Product Projection:  NAD_1983_UTM_Zone_17N
Standard Product Resolution:  0.3000 m
Rows:  5000
Columns:  5000
and resampled to align to the U.S. National Grid (USNG) using The National Map.  The naming convention is based on the U.S. National Grid (USNG), taking the coordinates of the SW corner of the orthoimage. The metadata were imported and updated for display through The National Map at http://nationalmap.gov/viewer.html    Chip-level metadata are provided in HTML and XML format. Data were compressed utilizing IAS software. The compression was JPEG2000 Lossy Compressed. The file format created was .jp2.</abstract>
      <purpose>"The purpose of the project is to provide current digital orthophotos. The digital orthophotos are used to support land management and acquisition, planning, and engineering for the state of Florida." A digital orthoimage is a geometrically accurate photographic record of landscape conditions at the time of the corresponding aerial photography. As such, High Resolution Orthoimagery is useful for a variety of applications, such as environmental monitoring, facility engineering/maintenance, city/county planning, property line review, etc. The digital orthoimage can be used alone or as a raster basemap for corresponding vector line mapping.  The detailed focus of High Resolution Orthoimagery provides emergency responders critical information in determining the best evacuation routes, alternative routes and safe access to aid.  High Resolution Orthoimagery assists law enforcement personnel in determining the best locations to place surveillance cameras in high-traffic urban areas and popular attractions.  The data assists Federal, State and local emergency responders in planning for homeland security efforts.  This data also supports The National Map.</purpose>
      <supplinf>The data obtained through The National Map is considered to be the "best available" data from USGS. Information in quotation marks, initial processing steps, accuracy reports, and source information is taken directly from the original metadata.</supplinf>

    <attracc>
      <attraccr>Radiometry is verified by visual inspection of the digital orthophoto.  Slight systematic radiometric differences may exist between adjacent orthoimage files; these are due primarily to differences in source image capture dates and sun angles along flight lines.  These differences can be observed in an image's general lightness or darkness when it is compared to adjacent orthoimage file coverages. Tonal balancing may be performed over a group of images during the mosaicking process which may serve to lighten or darken adjacent images for better color tone matching.</attraccr>

        <horizpar>"Orthophotography meets the USGS horizontal accuracy requirement of 5.06 feet at the 95 percent confidence level based on the National Standard for Spatial Data Accuracy (NSSDA)." The relative accuracy is assembled by comparing rectified images generated from adjacent strips of imagery. The absolute accuracy is assessed by measuring the ground control points in the rectified image against the actual surveyed co-ordinate position. The testing is for overall accuracy.  This data has been produced to be fully compliant with the National Map Accuracy Standards (NMAS) for mapping at this scale.</horizpar>

        <procdesc>"The imagery was collected by FDOT at an average altitude of 9500 feet using an Intergraph Digitam Mapping Camera (DMC). Image quality was verified during the post flight review phase.
Factors considered during this review included but were not limited to the presence of smoke and/or cloud cover, contrails, light conditions and sun glint.  Ground control consisted of photo identifiable surveyed points.
Aerotriangulation point measurement accomplished with a combination of automatic and manual point measurement.  Pass and tie points were automatically generated.  Control was manually measured.
A bundle adjustment was performed on the entire county.   A USGS 1 arc-second (approx. 30m)- Cont. U.S. Digital Elevation Model (DEM), along with breaklines that were collected stereoscopically from aquired iamgery were used
to create an updated DEM. The photography was orthorectified using the updated DEM.  Seamlines were generated using a combination of automated and manual seamlines generation.  Color balancing was applied during the
mosaic process to create seamless imagery to the highest extent practically achievable.   The DMC collects twelve bit image data which requires radiometric conversion to output in standard eight bit image channels.
Final image tiles were reviewed for artifacts and anomalies and adjusted as part of quality control procedures. When necessary, local corrections to the imagery
were performed to minimize such effects."</procdesc>
