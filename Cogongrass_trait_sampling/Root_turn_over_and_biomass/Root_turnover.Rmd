This data was given to me by Catherine (Cathy) Fahey on 7/20/2018

```{r}
root_growth <- readxl::read_excel("/Users/tess/Documents/work/SERDP_Project/Cogongrass_trait_sampling/Root_turn_over_and_biomass/rootgrowth.xlsx")

root_length <- readxl::read_excel("/Users/tess/Documents/work/SERDP_Project/Cogongrass_trait_sampling/Root_turn_over_and_biomass/rootlength.xlsx")

## Step 1: Calculate the average root length at each site




## Step 2: devide the root 
```
