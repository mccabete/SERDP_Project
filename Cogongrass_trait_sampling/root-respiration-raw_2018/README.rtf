These files correspond to the output from a LI6400 taken on 8/2/18 and 8/3/18. Respiration was measured by rerouting the sample-side tube through a mason jar containing either fine roots or rhizomes. The sample and reference tubes were matched, and then the data was autologeed for five minuets (although some records were logged for 10 mins). Temperature of the soil was taken with a buried  temperature logger. Dry-weight biomass was acquired  for all roots. \
 All roots are from a cogognrass invasion sampled at the Bivens research station associated with the Flory lab at university of Florida. Contact tmccabe@bu.edu for more information.  }
