These areas are in the vicinity of Amani Botanic Garden (ABG)\textemdash{}a propagule source for many alien plant species. We surveyed three edges in the vicinity of the ABG plantations, using plots interspersed along multiple 250~m transects. Survey plots were either in secondary or seminatural forest, representing a difference in past disturbance). Alien plant species richness and abundance declined with increasing distance from forest edges, indicating that edge effects were important. In addition, the effect of distance on richness and abundance of alien species as adults was much smaller in seminatural than secondary forest, emphasizing that invasion of seminatural forest is less likely to occur. Abundance and occurrence of individual species showed broadly similar declines with increasing distance from the forest edge, and lower abundance in seminatural compared to secondary forest. Alien species were dominant in 15 percent of plots surveyed. As 28 percent of the Amani nature reserve forest is within 250~m of an edge, the importance of disturbance and edges could make a potentially large proportion of the forest vulnerable to alien species invasion.},

  abstract = {Although savanna trees and forest trees are thought to represent distinct functional groups with different effects on ecosystem processes, few empirical studies have examined these effects. In particular, it remains unclear if savanna and forest trees differ in their ability to coexist with understory plants, which comprise the majority of plant diversity in most savannas. We used structural equation modeling (SEM) and data from 157 sites across three locations in the southeastern United States to understand the effects of broadleaf savanna trees, broadleaf forest trees, and pine trees on savanna understory plant communities. After accounting for underlying gradients in fire frequency and soil moisture, abundances (i.e., basal area and stem density) of forest trees and pines, but not savanna trees, were negatively correlated with the cover and density (i.e., local-scale species richness) of C4 graminoid species, a defining savanna understory functional group that is linked to ecosystem flammability. In analyses of the full understory community, abundances of trees from all functional groups were negatively correlated with species density and cover. For both the C4 and full communities, fire frequency promoted understory plants directly, and indirectly by limiting forest tree abundance. There was little indirect influence of fire on the understory mediated through savanna trees and pines, which are more fire tolerant than forest trees. We conclude that tree functional identity is an important factor that influences overstory tree relationships with savanna understory plant communities. In particular, distinct relationships between trees and C4 graminoids have implications for grass\textendash{}tree coexistence and vegetation\textendash{}fire feedbacks that maintain savanna environments and their associated understory plant diversity.},

The Evolution of Increased Competitive Ability (EICA) hypothesis (Blossey and N\"otzold 1995) proposes that evolutionary change in response to release from coevolved herbivores is responsible for the success of many invasive plant species. Studies that evaluate this hypothesis have used different approaches to test whether invasive populations allocate fewer resources to defense and more to growth and competitive ability than do source populations, with mixed results. We conducted a meta-analysis of experimental tests of evolutionary change in the context of EICA. In contrast to previous reviews, there was no support across invasive species for EICA's predictions regarding defense or competitive ability, although invasive populations were more productive than conspecific native populations under noncompetitive conditions. We found broad support for genetically based changes in defense and competitive plant traits after introduction into new ranges, but not in the manner suggested by EICA. This review suggests that evolution occurs as a result of plant introduction and population expansion in invasive plant species, and may contribute to the invasiveness and persistence of some introduced species.},

  abstract = {While many ecosystems depend on fire to maintain biodiversity, non-native plant invasions can enhance fire intensity, suppressing native species and generating a fire-invasion feedback. These dynamics have been observed in arid and semi-arid ecosystems, but fire-invasion interactions in temperate deciduous forests, where prescribed fires are often used as management tools to enhance native diversity, have rarely been investigated., Here we evaluated the effects of a widespread invasive grass on fire behaviour in eastern deciduous forests in the USA and the potential effects of fire and invasions on tree regeneration. We planted native trees into invaded and uninvaded forests, quantified fuel loads, then applied landscape-scale prescribed fires and no-burn controls, and measured fire behaviour and tree seedling and invasive plant performance., Our results show that fires in invaded habitats were significantly more intense, including higher fire temperatures, longer duration and higher flame heights, even though invasions did not alter total fuel loads. The invasion plus fire treatment suppressed native tree seedling survival by 54\% compared to invasions without fire, and invasions reduced natural tree recruitment by 66\%., We also show that invasive plant biomass did not change from one season to the next in plots where fire was applied, but invader biomass declined significantly in unburned reference plots, suggesting a positive invasive grass-fire feedback., Synthesis and applications. These findings demonstrate that fire-invasion interactions can have significant consequences for invaded temperate forest ecosystems by increasing fire intensity and reducing tree establishment while promoting invasive plant persistence. To encourage tree regeneration and slow invasive spread, we recommend that forest managers remove invasions prior to applying prescribed fires or avoid the use of fire in habitats invaded by non-native grasses.},

Club 117: 349-356. 1990.- Spatial patterns of fire temperatures from a tallgrass prairie and adjacent Gallery forest in northeast Kansas and a sandhill community in central Florida were recorded using temperature- sensitive pyrometers. The objectives of the study were to determine, in both habitats, the range of temperatures reached during prescribed burning under a range of different conditions. Both habitats are characterized by frequent, low-intensity fires confined to the herbaceous vegetation and low shrubs. In tallgrass prairie, fire temperature maxima ranged from 19 to 399?C (n = 243). The highest temperatures were associated with fires in isolated tree and shrub canopies (399?C). Fires were hotter in headfires compared with backfires (47?C difference), on lowlands compared with uplands (1 2?C difference), and in areas that had not been burned for many years compared with areas burned annually (34?C difference). In the Florida sandhill, fire temperature maxima ranged from 35 to 538?C (n = 240), with the highest temperatures recorded at ground level in sites which had not been burned for at least 5 years. Compared with frequently burned areas, areas that have not burned for many years build up high fuel loads that support a more homogeneous, hotter fire. In the tallgrass prairie, homogeneity of fire temperatures was greatest in areas of intermediate fire frequencies. The greater spatial heterogeneity in fire characteristics of prairie with very high fire frequency (annual fire) and very low frequency ( 15 years between fires) is likely a result of low fuel loads and more patchy vegetation structure, respectively. In sandhill, low fuel loads and patchy distribution of fuel contribute to high spatial variability in fire temperatures in annually burned sites.},

  doi = {10.1890/13-1362.1},
  abstract = {Grasslands have been lost and degraded in the United States since Euro- American settlement due to agriculture, development, introduced invasive species, and changes in fire regimes. Fire is frequently used in prairie restoration to control invasion by trees and shrubs, but may have additional consequences. For example, fire might reduce damage by herbivore and pathogen enemies by eliminating litter, which harbors eggs and spores. Less obviously, fire might influence enemy loads differently for native and introduced plant hosts. We used a controlled burn in a Willamette Valley (Oregon) prairie to examine these questions. We expected that, without fire, introduced host plants should have less damage than native host plants because the introduced species are likely to have left many of their enemies behind when they were transported to their new range (the enemy release hypothesis, or ERH). If the ERH holds, then fire, which should temporarily reduce enemies on all species, should give an advantage to the natives because they should see greater total reduction in damage by enemies. Prior to the burn, we censused herbivore and pathogen attack on eight plant species (five of nonnative origin: Bromus hordaceous, Cynosuros echinatus, Galium divaricatum, Schedonorus arundinaceus (\textonequarter{}Festuca arundinacea), and Sherardia arvensis; and three natives: Danthonia californica, Epilobium minutum,and Lomatium nudicale). The same plots were monitored for two years post-fire. Prior to the burn, native plants had more kinds of damage and more pathogen damage than introduced plants, consistent with the ERH. Fire reduced pathogen damage relative to the controls more for the native than the introduced species, but the effects on herbivory were negligible. Pathogen attack was correlated with plant reproductive fitness, whereas herbivory was not. These results suggest that fire may be useful for promoting some native plants in prairies due to its negative effects on their pathogens.},

  abstract = {Wildfires are often governed by rapid changes in seasonal rainfall. Therefore, measuring seasonal rainfall on a temporally finescale should facilitate the prediction of wildfire regimes. To explore this hypothesis, daily rainfall data over a 58-yr period (1950-2007) in south-central Florida were transformed into cumulative rainfall anomalies (CRAs). This transformation allowed precise estimation of onset dates and durations of the dry and wet seasons, as well as a number of other variables characterizing seasonal rainfall. These variables were compared with parameters that describe ENSO and a wildfire regime in the region (at the Avon Park Air Force Ranee). Onset dates and durations were found to be highly variable among years, with standard deviations ranging from 27 to 41 days. Rainfall during the two seasons was distinctive, with the dry season having half as much as the wet season despite being nearly 2 times as long. The precise quantification of seasonal rainfall led to strong statistical models describing linkages between climate and wildfires: a multiple-regression technique relating the area burned with the seasonal rainfall characteristics had an R(adj)(2) of 0.61, and a similar analysis examining the number of wildfires had an R(adj)(2) of 0.56. Moreover, the CRA approach was effective in outlining how seasonal rainfall was associated with ENSO, particularly during the strongest and most unusual events (e.g., El Nino of 1997/98). Overall, the results presented here show that using CRAs helped to define the linkages among seasonality, ENS, and wildfires in south-central Florida, and they suggest that this approach can be used in other fire-prone ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Forest edges created by dispersed-patch clear-cutting have become a con-spicuous landscape feature in western North America, but the effects of edge on forest structure and function are still poorly understood. In this paper we describe responses of stocking density, growth, mortality, and regeneration for three conifer species from the clear-cut edge into the interior of old-growth forest patches adjacent to 10-15 yr old clearcuts in southern Washington and central Oregon. The significance of edge effects for each variable was tested through a single-factor (distance) analysis of variance (F test). Relationships between these variables and depth-of-edge influence (i.e., edge width) on old-growth forest were characterized by nonlinear regression models. Near the edge (forest-clearcut boundary line), the old-growth forest has (1) reduced stocking density, as measured by canopy cover, number of stems per hectare, and basal area; (2) increased growth rates of dominant Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), as calcu-lated by an index of relative growth rate; (3) elevated rates of tree mortality, as measured by standing dead and down trees (snags and logs); and (4) greater numbers of Douglas-fir and western hemlock seedlings (100 cm tall) and saplings (10 1-200 cm) but fewer of Pacific silver fir (Abies amabilis). The depth-of-edge influence, when calculated as the point along the clearcut-forest gradient at which a given variable has returned to a condition representing 2/3 of the interior forest environment, ranged from 16 to 137 m for variables related to distance from the edge. The amount of a square forest patch affected by edge decreased as patch size increased and varied greatly with the depth-of-edge influence. With increasing concerns about organisms and processes that require interior forest habitat, determining the area of residual forest influenced by adjacent clearcut is critical to current and future resource management. Responses of additional biological variables must be explored and information on edge phenomena should be extended to the scale of landscapes.},

  abstract = {The frequent fires typical of the longleaf pine ecosystem in the south-eastern USA are carried by live understorey vegetation and pine litter. Mature longleaf pine stands in the xeric sandhills region have a variable understorey vegetation layer, creating several fuel complexes at the within-stand scale (20 m2). We identified three fuel complexes found in frequently burned stands on the Carolina Sandhills National Wildlife Refuge, and used prescribed fire to test whether distinct sets of fire conditions were associated with each fuel complex. Study plots were dominated by either turkey oak or wiregrass in the understorey, or lacked understorey vegetation and contained only longleaf pine litter. Turkey oak-dominated plots had the highest fuel loads, and during burns they had higher total net heat flux than wiregrass- or longleaf pine litter-dominated plots, and longer burn durations than wiregrass-dominated plots. Across all plots, the quantity of litter fragments had the greatest effect on fire temperature and duration of burn. These results show that the patchy understorey vegetation within longleaf pine stands will create heterogeneous fires, and areas dominated by turkey oak may have increased fire intensity and soil heating compared with the other two fuel complexes.},

  abstract = {Invasion ecology, the study of how organisms spread in habitats to which they are not native, asks both about the invasiveness of species and the invasibility of habitats: Which species are most likely to become invasive? Which habitats are most susceptible to invasion? To set the stage for considering these questions with regard to plants, we offer a two-way classification of nativeness and invasiveness that distinguishes natives, non-invasive non-natives and invasive non-natives. We then consider the current state of knowledge about invasiveness and invasibility. Despite much investigation, it has proven difficult to identify traits that consistently predict invasiveness. This may be largely because different traits favour invasiveness in different habitats. It has proven easier to identify types of habitats that are relatively invasible, such as islands and riverbanks. Factors thought to render habitats invasible include low intensities of competition, altered disturbance regimes and low levels of environmental stress, especially high resource availability. These factors probably often interact; the combination of altered disturbance with high resource availability may particularly promote invasibility. When biotic factors control invasibility, non-natives that are unlike native species may prove more invasive; the converse may also be true. We end with a simple conceptual model for cases in which high levels of environmental stress should and should not reduce invasibility. In some cases, it may be possible to manipulate stress to control biological invasions by plants.},

Using data from plots of varying ages from 17 to 210 years, monitored from 1958 to 2011 in western Canada, we found that climate change has little effect on net biomass change in forests $\leq$ 40 years of age due to increased growth offsetting increased mortality, but has led to large decreases in older forests due to increased mortality accompanying little growth gain. Our analysis highlights the need to incorporate forest age profiles in examining past and projecting future forest responses to climate change.},

  abstract = {Plant invasions are a current threat to biodiversity conservation, second only to habitat loss and fragmentation. Density and heights of three invasive plants, Rosa multiflora, Lonicera japonica, and Elaeagnus umbellata, were examined between edges and adjacent interiors of forest sites in southern Illinois. Density (stemsm-2) and heights (cm) of invasive plants were obtained in plots along transects at edge and interior sampling locations within forest sites. The effect of species, sampling location, and site shape index on invasive plant density was investigated, as well as differences in heights of invasive plants in edge vs. interior sampling locations. Species, sampling location, and fragment shape index were significant factors influencing invasive plant density at study sites. Density for all three species ranged from 0 to 18stemsm-2. All three species invaded interiors of sites, however, R. multiflora and L. japonica had significantly greater densities in edge as opposed to interior transects. These two species also had significant differences in density among site shape indices. Density of E. umbellata was not significantly different between edge and interior sampling locations or among site shape indices. Mean heights of all three invasive plants were higher in edge transects, however, this relationship was only significant for L. japonica. These findings suggest that (1) preservation of tracts of forest with less edge can minimize invasion by these three plants in this area. Interiors of forest sites can be protected from invasion by having less edge habitat for invasive species to enter and become established; and (2) E. umbellata, unlike the other two species, is established in both interior and edges of study sites. Therefore, E. umbellata may pose the most ecological damage because it is well established throughout sites, and should be given a high priority when implementing management and control efforts in southern Illinois forest ecosystems. \textcopyright{} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

We find that separate effects of heterogeneity in land cover, vegetation, climate, soil and topography are significantly positive, with vegetation and topographic heterogeneity showing particularly strong associations with species richness. The use of equal-area study units, spatial grain and spatial extent emerge as key factors influencing the strength of heterogeneity\textendash{}richness relationships, highlighting the pervasive influence of spatial scale in heterogeneity\textendash{}richness studies.

The altered disturbance regime in plant communities along corridor edges and vehicle traffic facilitate the spread and establishment of invasive non-native plant species. We compared the frequency of non-native plant species along highways and railways and the ability of these species to invade grasslands and dense forests along these corridors. We measured the frequency of several non-native plant species along transects 0-150 m from the edge of highways and railways in grasslands and forests, as well as at control sites away from corridors. Both transportation corridors had higher frequency of non-native species than respective control sites. Grasslands had higher frequency of non-native species than forested habitats, but the frequency did not differ between the highways and the railways. The frequency of non-native species in grasslands along highways and railways was higher than at grassland control sites up to 150 m from the corridor edge, whereas the frequency in forested habitats along corridors was higher than at forested control sites up to only 10 m from the corridor edge. There was a significant decrease in the frequency of non-native species with increasing distance from both corridors in the forest, while grasslands showed no significant change in non-native species frequency with distance from corridors. This suggests that corridor edges and grassland habitats act as microhabitats for non-native species and are more prone to invasion than forests, especially if disturbed. Our results emphasize the importance of minimizing the disturbance of adjacent plant communities along highways and railways during construction and maintenance, particularly in grassland habitats and in areas sensitive to additional fragmentation and habitat loss. \textcopyright{} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Three flawed practices associated with model averaging coefficients for predictor variables in regression models commonly occur when making multimodel inferences in analyses of ecological data. Model-averaged regression coefficients based on Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) weights were recommended by Burnham and Anderson (2002, 2004) for addressing model uncertainty but they are not valid, interpretable estimates of partial effects for individual predictors when there is multicollinearity among the predictor variables. Multicollinearity implies that the scaling of units in the denominators of the regression coefficients may change across models such that neither the parameters nor their estimates have common scales, and thus averaging them makes no sense. The associated sums of AIC model weights recommended to assess relative importance of individual predictors are a measure of relative importance of models, with little information about contributions by individual predictors. Sometimes the model-averaged regression coefficients for predictor variables are incorrectly used to make model-averaged predictions of the response variable when the models are not linear in the parameters. I demonstrate the issues with the first two practices using the college grade point average example extensively analyzed by Burnham and Anderson (2002). I show how partial standard deviations of the predictor variables can be used to detect changing scales of their estimates with multicollinearity. Standardizing estimates based on partial standard deviations for their variables can be used to make the scaling of the estimates commensurate across models, a necessary but not sufficient condition for model averaging of the estimates to be sensible. The standardized estimates or equivalently the t-statistics on unstandardized estimates also can be used to provide more informative measures of relative importance than sums of AIC weights. Finally, I illustrate how seriously compromised statistical interpretations and predictions can be for all three of these flawed practices by critiquing their use in a recent species distribution modeling technique developed by Rice et al. (2013) for predicting greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) distribution in Colorado. These model averaging issues are common in other ecological literature and ought to be discontinued if we are to make effective scientific contributions to ecological knowledge and conservation of natural resources.},

Roadkills are a premier mortality source, yet except for local spots, rates rarely limit population size. Road avoidance, especially due to traffic noise, has a greater ecological impact. The still-more-important barrier effect subdivides populations, with demographic and probably genetic consequences. Road networks crossing landscapes cause local hydrologic and erosion effects, whereas stream networks and distant valleys receive major peak-flow and sediment impacts. Chemical effects mainly occur near roads. Road networks interrupt horizontal ecological flows, alter landscape spatial pattern, and therefore inhibit important interior species. Thus, road density and network structure are informative landscape ecology assays. Australia has huge road-reserve networks of native vegetation, whereas the Dutch have tunnels and overpasses perforating road barriers to enhance ecological flows. Based on road-effect zones, an estimated 15-20\% of the United States is ecologically impacted by roads.},

Given that most managed systems have higher primary productivity than adjacent natural systems, theory suggests that bottom-up subsidized consumers are likely to spill over from managed to natural habitats. Furthermore, the magnitude of spillover is likely to differ between generalist and specialist consumers, because of differences in their ability to use the full spectrum of resources. However, it is unknown whether there is indeed asymmetrical spillover of consumers between managed and natural habitats, and whether this is related to resource abundance or the trophic specialization of the consumer. We used flight intercept traps to measure spillover of generalist predators (Vespula wasps, Vespidae) and more specialist predators (106 species of parasitoids, Ichneumonidae and Braconidae) across habitat edges between native New Zealand forest and exotic plantation forest over a summer season....},

The diverse vegetation in these ecosystems varies at these fine scales. This diversity could be driven by the influences of local interactions among patches of understorey vegetation and canopy-supplied fine fuels on fire behavior, yet no method we know of can capture fine-scale fuel and fire measurements such that these relationships could be rigorously tested. We present here an original method for inventorying of fine-scale fuels and in situ measures of fire intensity within longleaf pine forests of the south-eastern USA. Using ground-based LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) with traditional fuel inventory approaches, we characterized within-fuel bed variation into discrete patches, termed wildland fuel cells, which had distinct fuel composition, characteristics, and architecture that became spatially independent beyond 0.5 m2. Spatially explicit fire behavior was measured in situ through digital infrared thermography. We found that fire temperatures and residence times varied at similar scales to those observed for wildland fuel cells. The wildland fuels cell concept could seamlessly connect empirical studies with numerical models or cellular automata models of fire behavior, representing a promising means to better predict within-burn heterogeneity and fire effects.},

  abstract = {Fire managers often model pine needles as 1 h timelag fuels, but fuelbed properties may significantly change the rate at which needles exchange moisture with the atmosphere. The problem of determining whether moisture loss from fine fuels is being controlled by individual particles or by the fuelbed remains unresolved. Results from this laboratory experiment indicate that first-period timelags of longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) needles are altered by fuelbed loading and needle arrangement. Timelags of individual needles ranged from 3.3 to 5.3 h; timelags of beds of vertically oriented needles (4.4 to 8.6 h) approximated those of individual particles, but were slightly influenced by loading. Beds of horizontal needles dried with load-dependent timelags that varied from 6.5 to 31.6 h. Fuel loads ranged from 0.04 (for individual particles) to 1.07 kg\textperiodcentered{}m-2. We report a new metric, the area drying rate, which is analogous to a unit-area burning rate. For beds of flat needles, plots of the area drying rate versus fuel load illustrate a transition from control by individual particles to control by the bed structure when fuel loading is approximately 0.33 kg\textperiodcentered{}m-2. Beds of vertical needles were particle controlled. Results should be useful to fire managers when modeling fire behavior. \textcopyright{} 2008 NRC.},

We evaluated the evidence for the three necessary links in the hypothesized causal chain linking high vertebrate diversity to a high probability of emergence of infectious diseases. We found no support for one critical link-that high total diversity of vertebrate pathogens correlates with high diversity of actual or potential zoonotic pathogens. In contrast, there is now substantial evidence that high diversity protects humans against the transmission of many existing diseases.

  abstract = {Non-native, invasive grasses have been linked to altered grass-fire cycles worldwide. Although a few studies have quantified resulting changes in fire activity at local scales, and many have speculated about larger scales, regional alterations to fire regimes remain poorly documented. We assessed the influence of large-scale Bromus tectorum (hereafter cheatgrass) invasion on fire size, duration, spread rate, and interannual variability in comparison to other prominent land cover classes across the Great Basin, USA. We compared regional land cover maps to burned area measured using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for 2000-2009 and to fire extents recorded by the USGS registry of fires from 1980 to 2009. Cheatgrass dominates at least 6\% of the central Great Basin (650 000 km(2) ). MODIS records show that 13\% of these cheatgrass-dominated lands burned, resulting in a fire return interval of 78 years for any given location within cheatgrass. This proportion was more than double the amount burned across all other vegetation types (range: 0.5-6\% burned). During the 1990s, this difference was even more extreme, with cheatgrass burning nearly four times more frequently than any native vegetation type (16\% of cheatgrass burned compared to 1-5\% of native vegetation). Cheatgrass was also disproportionately represented in the largest fires, comprising 24\% of the land area of the 50 largest fires recorded by MODIS during the 2000s. Furthermore, multi-date fires that burned across multiple vegetation types were significantly more likely to have started in cheatgrass. Finally, cheatgrass fires showed a strong interannual response to wet years, a trend only weakly observed in native vegetation types. These results demonstrate that cheatgrass invasion has substantially altered the regional fire regime. Although this result has been suspected by managers for decades, this study is the first to document recent cheatgrass-driven fire regimes at a regional scale.},

The fire treatment was applied with an instrument system that allowed precise control over the intensity and duration of fire, and full documentation of the temperatures experienced in various regions of each plant during the fire and postfire cooling phases. A quantitative index of fire exposure, or severity, for each plant was obtained by integrating the temperature curve for the meristematic crown region over the fire and postfire cooling periods. No significant plant mortality was observed at any fire severity level. Although tissue damage in newly initiated culms wasobservedfor Festuca, this didnot significantly affect culm or biomass productivity. Culm production was initiated earlier and more rapidly in Festuca than Agropyron, and within 60 days after fire exposure the total number of culms produced in Festuca was nearly that of unburned plants. Aboveground biomass for both species was significantly less than that of unburned plants at the end of this 60-day period. Agropyron exhibited significantly less culm and biomass production at a moderate fire severity, whereas high fire severity was required for this reduction in Festuca. Contrary to previous studies, Festuca thus appears less sensitive to fire injury than Agropyron},

These same habitat types are also favored by ticks. This convergence suggests that habitat modifications caused by exotic plant invasions may mediate disease vector habitat quality, indirectly affecting human disease risk at the local spatial scale. We tested the hypothesis that experimental invasions of Japanese stiltgrass, Microstegium vimineum (Trin.) A. Camus, alter soil surface microclimate conditions, thereby reducing habitat quality for ticks. Microstegium is an exotic annual grass that is highly invasive throughout the eastern United States where the vector ticks Amblyomma americanum (Linnaeus) and Dermancentor variabilis (Say) occur. Ticks (n=100 per species) were introduced into experimentally invaded and native vegetation control plots (n=5 per treatment). D. variabilis mortality rate increased 173\% and A. americanum mortality rate increased 70\% in the invaded plots relative to those in control plots. Microstegium invasion also resulted in a 13.8\% increase in temperature and an 18.8\% decrease in humidity, which are known to increase tick mortality. We predict that areas invaded by Microstegium will have lower densities of host-seeking ticks and therefore reduced human disease risk. Our results emphasize the role of invasive species in mediating disease vector populations, the unpredictable consequences of biological invasions, and the need for integrative management strategies that can simultaneous address exotic plant invasions and vector-borne disease.},

Location: Kisatchie National Forest, Western Gulf Coastal Plain, longleaf pine-bluestem ecosystem, in relatively rough topography adjacent to the Red River, Louisiana, USA. Methods: Cross-sections of 19 remnant pines exhibiting 190 fire scars were collected from a 1.2-km(2) area. Tree-rings and fire scars were precisely dated and analysed for the purpose of characterizing past changes in fire and tree growth. Temporal variability in fire occurrence and seasonality was described for the pre- and post-European settlement periods. Seasonality of historic fires was determined by the scar position within the rings. The relationship between fire and drought was investigated using correlation and superposed epoch analysis. Results: The mean fire return interval for the period 1650-1905 was 2.2 years (range 0.5 to 12 yr). Significant new findings include: evidence for years of biannual burning, temporal variability in fire seasonality, an increase in fire frequency and percentage of trees scarred circa 1790, and synchronous growth suppression and subsequent release of trees coinciding with land-use changes near the turn of the 20th century. Drought conditions appeared unrelated to the occurrence of fire events or fire seasonality. Conclusions: Multi-century fire history records from longleaf pine ecosystems are difficult to obtain due to historic land-use practices and the species high resistance to scarring; however, our results indicate potential for reconstructing detailed fire histories in this ecosystem. Fire scars quantitatively documented one of the most frequent fire regimes known. Fire regime information, such as the temporal variability in fire intervals, prevalence of late-growing season fire events and biannual burning, provide a new perspective on the dynamics of longleaf pine fire regimes.},

Hickory leaves, however, neither increased nor decreased fire characteristics relative to herbaceous fuels. * All hickories survived fire by resprouting. When pine needles were absent, most hickories resprouted from buds located above-ground along the stem at heights inversely related to temperature increase. In contrast, resprouting occurred only from underground root crowns when pine needles were present. Such differences in locations of resprouts influenced sizes of stems at the end of the growing season. * Synthesis. Groundcover fuels containing flammable leaves shed by pyrogenic species of savanna trees affect local fire characteristics and resprouting of non-pyrogenic understorey trees.

  abstract = {Abstract. Invasive alien grasses can increase fuel loads, leading to changes in fire regimes of invaded ecosystems by increasing the frequency, intensity and spatial extent of fires. Andropogon gayanus Kunth. (Gamba grass), a tall perennial grass from Africa, is invading ecosystems in the Top End of northern Australia. To determine whether A. gayanus alters savanna fire regimes, we compared fuel loads and fire intensities at invaded sites with those from native grass savannas. Savanna invaded by A. gayanus had fuel loads up to seven times higher than those dominated by native grasses. This higher fuel load supported a fire that was on average eight times more intense than those recorded in native grass savannas at the same time of year (means 15700 $\pm$ 6200 and 2100 $\pm$ 290 kW m-1 , respectively), and was the highest early dry season fire intensities ever recorded in the Northern Territory. These results suggest that A. gayanus is a serious threat to northern Australia's savannas, with the potential to alter vegetation structure and initiate a grass-fire cycle.

  abstract = {Invasion ecology has traditionally focused on exotic plant species with early successional life-history traits, adapted to colonize areas following disturbance. However, the ecological importance of these traits may be overstated, in part because most invasive plants originate from intentional introductions. Furthermore, this focus neglects the types of plants most likely to invade established communities, particularly forests - namely shade-tolerant, late-successional species. In invasion ecology, it is generally assumed that undisturbed forests are highly resistant to plant invasions. Our review reveals that this assumption is not justified: in temperate and tropical regions around the world, at least 139 exotic plant species are known to have invaded deeply shaded forest understories that have not undergone substantial disturbance. These exotics present a particular management challenge, as they often increase in abundance during succession. While forest invasions may develop comparatively slowly under natural disturbance regimes, anthropogenic processes, including the spread of exotic pests and pathogens, can be expected to accelerate the rate of invasion.},

The pattern of mast years resulted in no competing juveniles less than 9 years of age. 2 Approximately 3000 juveniles were measured from 336 study plots placed in areas of low and high adult tree densities. Needle density was measured in each study plot prior to a prescribed burn conducted during the second year. Maximum fire temperatures were measured using temperature sensitive tablets. 3 Relationships among variables were quantified using path analysis. Path models were developed for independent and dependent variables before and after fire. 4 Survival, size and spatial distributions of pregrass stage longleaf pines were strongly affected by adult density, both in the absence and presence of fire. Juveniles in areas of low adult density were larger, and survival was higher. Aggregation of juveniles in areas of low adult densities was evident as early as the first year of growth and in the absence of fire. 5 Needle densities also affected juveniles in the absence of fire. Juveniles in areas of low needle litter accumulations were larger and had higher survival. Areas of low needle accumulations occurred in areas of low adult densities. 6 Fire markedly affected survival of juvenile longleaf pines. Only 21\% of the initial cohort were alive one month after fire. Higher survival occurred in areas of low adult density, where juveniles were larger and needle density and fire temperatures were lower. Fire temperature was strongly related to needle density; hotter fire temperatures occurred in areas of greater needle density. Aggregation of juveniles was intensified after fire with higher densities of juveniles found in areas of low density of adults.},

  abstract = {Frequent fire is an integral component of longleaf pine ecosystems, creating environmental conditions favoring survival and growth of juvenile pines. This study examined stand structure, species composition, and longleaf pine regeneration in an old-growth tract of longleaf pine forest (Boyd Tract) experiencing long-term (80 yr) fire exclusion in the Sandhills of North Carolina. Sampling of woody stems (i.e., $\geq$2.5 cm diameter at breast height) and tallies of longleaf pine seedlings were carried out in plots established randomly on upland, mesic areas and lowland, xeric areas within the Boyd Tract. Dominant woody species in mesic plots were black oak, hickories, and large, sparse longleaf pines. Xeric plots had high densities of turkey oak with the large longleaf pines, as well as higher frequencies of smaller longleaf stems. These differences between areas were associated with higher clay content of upland soils and higher sand content of lowland soils. Age-class frequency distributions for fire- suppressed longleaf pine following the last wildfire at the Boyd Tract approximately 80 yr ago contrasted sharply with data from an old-growth longleaf tract in southern Georgia (Wade Tract) that has been under a long-term frequent fire regime. Post-burn recruitment for the Boyd Tract wildfire appears to have been initially high on both site types. Longleaf pine recruitment diminished sharply on the mesic site, but remained high for $\sim$60 yr on the xeric site. Currently, longleaf pine regeneration is minimal on both site types; several plots contained no seedlings. Sharp contrasts in longleaf pine dominance and stand structure between the Boyd and Wade Tracts demonstrate the importance of large-scale disturbance, especially hurricanes and fire, in shaping the structure and function of longleaf pine ecosystems of the southeastern United States. In particular, long-term exclusion of fire on the Boyd Tract has altered stand structure dramatically by permitting hardwoods to occupy at high densities the characteristically large gaps between longleaf stems that are maintained by fire and other disturbances},

Watersheds burned at 1-year intervals had fewer larvae and adults than watersheds burned at 4-year or 20-year intervals. Watersheds burned during the year of sampling had fewer ticks than watersheds burned one or more years in the past. For watersheds burned 1 or more years in the past there was no effect from time since burn. The presence of bison did not affect tick abundance.

Genetic changes in introduced populations may promote invasiveness by increasing plant vigor and plasticity. To determine if introduced populations of the annual grass Microstegium vimineum exhibit greater growth than populations from the native range, we grew plants from 10 native (China) and 10 introduced (U.S.) populations in the greenhouse under two light environments and evaluated growth and morphological traits across two harvest dates. Microstegium from introduced populations had on average 50\% and 35\% greater biomass in the shade and sun, respectively, than native populations at the first harvest and 59\% and 33\% greater biomass by the second harvest date. We found no difference in plasticity for growth across the light treatments between native and introduced populations. There were significant morphological differences in resource allocation with native populations producing greater leaf area and leaf mass per stem mass than introduced populations. However, introduced populations produced more biomass overall, despite lower allocation to leaves, which suggests greater efficiency of photosynthesis or lower respiration. These results demonstrate significant genetic differences between introduced and native populations of Microstegium for growth and morphological characteristics.

Predicting fecundity across large spatial scales, from regions to landscapes, is critical for understanding invasion dynamics and optimizing management. However, to accurately predict fecundity and other demographic processes, improved models that scale individual plant responses to abiotic drivers across heterogeneous environments are needed. Here we combine two experimental data sets to predict fecundity of a widespread and problematic invasive grass over large spatial scales. First, we analyzed seed production as a function of plant biomass in a small-scale mesocosm experiment with manipulated light levels. Then, in a field introduction experiment, we tracked plant performance across 21 common garden sites that differed widely in available light and other factors. We jointly analyzed these data using a Bayesian hierarchical model (BHM) framework to predict fecundity as a function of light in the field. Our analysis re...},

  abstract = {Plant species introduced into novel ranges may become invasive due to evolutionary change, phenotypic plasticity, or other biotic or abiotic mechanisms. Evolution of introduced populations could be the result of founder effects, drift, hybridization, or adaptation to local conditions, which could enhance the invasiveness of introduced species. However, understanding whether the success of invading populations is due to genetic differences between native and introduced populations may be obscured by origin x environment interactions. That is, studies conducted under a limited set of environmental conditions may show inconsistent results if native or introduced populations are differentially adapted to specific conditions. We tested for genetic differences between native and introduced populations, and for origin x environment interactions, between native (China) and introduced (U.S.) populations of the invasive annual grass Microstegium vimineum (stiltgrass) across 22 common gardens spanning a wide range of habitats and environmental conditions. On average, introduced populations produced 46\% greater biomass and had 7.4\% greater survival, and outperformed native range populations in every common garden. However, we found no evidence that introduced Microstegium exhibited greater phenotypic plasticity than native populations. Biomass of Microstegium was positively correlated with light and resident community richness and biomass across the common gardens. However, these relationships were equivalent for native and introduced populations, suggesting that the greater mean performance of introduced populations is not due to unequal responses to specific environmental parameters. Our data on performance of invasive and native populations suggest that post-introduction evolutionary changes may have enhanced the invasive potential of this species. Further, the ability of Microstegium to survive and grow across the wide variety of environmental conditions demonstrates that few habitats are immune to invasion.},

  abstract = {Evolutionary dynamics of integrative traits such as phenology are predicted to be critically important to range expansion and invasion success, yet there are few empirical examples of such phenomena. In this study, we used multiple common gardens to examine the evolutionary significance of latitudinal variation in phenology of a widespread invasive species, the Asian short-day flowering annual grass Microstegium vimineum. In environmentally controlled growth chambers, we grew plants from seeds collected from multiple latitudes across the species' invasive range. Flowering time and biomass were both strongly correlated with the latitude of population origin such that populations collected from more northern latitudes flowered significantly earlier and at lower biomass than populations from southern locations. We suggest that this pattern may be the result of rapid adaptive evolution of phenology over a period of less than one hundred years and that such changes have likely promoted the northward range expansion of this species. We note that possible barriers to gene flow, including bottlenecks and inbreeding, have apparently not forestalled evolutionary processes for this plant. Furthermore, we hypothesize that evolution of phenology may be a widespread and potentially essential process during range expansion for many invasive plant species.},

  abstract = {Phenotypic plasticity is a common feature of plant invaders, but little is known about variation in plasticity among invading populations. Variation in plasticity of ecologically important traits could facilitate the evolution of greater plasticity and invasiveness. We examined plasticity among invasive populations of Microstegium vimineum (Japanese stiltgrass), a widespread and often dominant grass of forests in the eastern U. S. with two separate experiments. First, we exposed seven Microstegium populations to a drought treatment in growth chambers and monitored growth and physiological responses. Then, we established a greenhouse experiment using a subset of the populations; two that exhibited the most divergent responses and one intermediate population. In the greenhouse, we manipulated drought and shade and evaluated biomass production and specific leaf area (SLA). Microstegium exhibited plasticity for biomass production and SLA in the greenhouse experiment, and populations significantly varied in the degree of plasticity under drought and shade treatments. Two populations significantly increased biomass production under favorable conditions, unlike the third population. The most productive populations also responded to shade stress via greater SLA, possibly allowing for greater utilization of available light, while the third population did not. These results show that Microstegium can exhibit plastic responses to environmental conditions. Moreover, variation for plasticity among populations provides the potential for further evolution of plasticity. Future studies should focus on the relative importance of plasticity for the success of Microstegium and other plant invaders and evaluate post-introduction evolution of plasticity. \textcopyright{} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.},

  abstract = {A set of experiments at laboratory scale was conducted to study the combustion of forest fuel beds in order to quantify the contribution of radiant and convective heat transfer under slope condition. To proceed, a Large Scale Heat Release apparatus was used to measure the heat release rate and fire properties such as the mass loss rate, the geometry of the fire front and the heat transfer were assessed. Because of the slope and the size of the fuel bed, the mass loss rate and the heat release rate do not reach a quasi-steady state when the propagation takes place under slope condition. This is due to a V-shape distortion of the fire front, which leads to an increase of the burnt surface rate by the fire over time. The study of this quantity has shown that the heat release over time can be estimated with the fuel load and the time derivative of the burnt surface. The fractions of radiation and convection released by the fire in its environment were calculated. Under a slope of 20$^\circ$, the convective fraction decreases from 74.9\% to 61.1\% whereas the overall radiant fraction ranges between 25.1\% and 38.9\% and increases with increasing fuel loads.},

  doi = {10.1098/rspb.2014.2124},
  abstract = {Viruses that originate in bats may be the most notorious emerging zoonoses that spill over from wildlife into domestic animals and humans. Understanding how these infections filter through ecological systems to cause disease in humans is of profound importance to public health. Transmission of viruses from bats to humans requires a hierarchy of enabling conditions that connect the distribution of reservoir hosts, viral infection within these hosts, and exposure and susceptibility of recipient hosts. For many emerging bat viruses, spillover also requires viral shedding from bats, and survival of the virus in the environment. Focusing on Hendra virus, but also addressing Nipah virus, Ebola virus, Marburg virus and coronaviruses, we delineate this cross-species spillover dynamic from the within-host processes that drive virus excretion to land-use changes that increase interaction among species. We describe how land-use changes may affect co-occurrence and contact between bats and recipient hosts. Two hypotheses may explain temporal and spatial pulses of virus shedding in bat populations: episodic shedding from persistently infected bats or transient epidemics that occur as virus is transmitted among bat populations. Management of livestock also may affect the probability of exposure and disease. Interventions to decrease the probability of virus spillover can be implemented at multiple levels from targeting the reservoir host to managing recipient host exposure and susceptibility.},

  abstract = {Knowing how species respond to fire regimes is essential for ecologically sustainable management. This axiom raises two important questions: (1) what knowledge is the most important to develop and (2) to what extent can current research methods deliver that knowledge? We identify three areas of required knowledge: (i) a mechanistic understanding of species' responses to fire regimes; (ii) knowledge of how the spatial and temporal arrangement of fires influences the biota; and (iii) an understanding of interactions of fire regimes with other processes. We review the capacity of empirical research to address these knowledge gaps, and reveal many limitations. Manipulative experiments are limited by the number and scope of treatments that can be applied, natural experiments are limited by treatment availability and confounding factors, and longitudinal studies are difficult to maintain, particularly due to unplanned disturbance events. Simulation modelling is limited by the quality of the underlying empirical data and by uncertainty in how well model structure represents reality. Due to the constraints on large-scale, long-term research, the potential for management experiments to inform adaptive management is limited. Rather than simply recommending adaptive management, we define a research agenda to maximise the rate of learning in this difficult field. This includes measuring responses at a species level, building capacity to implement natural experiments, undertaking simulation modelling, and judicious application of experimental approaches. Developing ecologically sustainable fire management practices will require sustained research effort and a sophisticated research agenda based on carefully targeting appropriate methods to address critical management questions. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Over the past 20 years, major advances have clarified how ecological patterns inform theory, and how in turn theory informs applied ecology. Also, there has been an increased recognition that the problem of scale at which ecological processes should be considered is critical if we are to produce general predictions. Ecological dynamics is always stochastic at small scales, but variability is conditional on the scale of description. The radical changes in the scope and aims of ecology over the past decades reflect in part the need to address pressing societal issues of environmental change. Technological advances in molecular biology, global positioning, sensing instrumentation and computational power should not be overlooked as an explanation for these radical changes. However, I argue that conceptual unification across ecology, genetics, evolution and physiology has fostered even more fertile questions. We are moving away from the view that evolution is played in a fixed ecological theatre: the theatre is being rapidly and relentlessly redesigned by the players themselves. The maintenance of ecosystem functions depends on shifts in species assemblages and on cellular metabolism, not only on flows of energy and matter. These findings have far reaching implications for our understanding of how ecosystem function and biodiversity will withstand (or not) environmental changes in the 21st century.},

The largest fires travelled more than 1000 m from the origin and the fastest 2-minute spread rate was over 2 m s-1. Given continuous fuel of uniform moisture content, the rate of forward spread was related to both the wind speed and the width of the head fire measured normal to the direction of fire travel. The head fire width required to achieve the potential quasi-steady rate of forward spread for the prevailing conditions increased with increasing wind speeds. These findings have important implications for relating small-scale field or laboratory measurements of fire spread to predictions of wildfire spread. The time taken to reach the potential quasi-steady rate of spread at any wind speed was highly variable. This time was strongly influenced by the frequency of changes in wind direction and the rate of development of a wide head fire.},

  abstract = {In light of global climate change, ecological studies increasingly address effects of temperature on organisms and ecosystems. To measure air temperature at biologically relevant scales in the field, ecologists often use small, portable temperature sensors. Sensors must be shielded from solar radiation to provide accurate temperature measurements, but our review of 18 years of ecological literature indicates that shielding practices vary across studies (when reported at all), and that ecologists often invent and construct ad hoc radiation shields without testing their efficacy. We performed two field experiments to examine the accuracy of temperature observations from three commonly used portable data loggers (HOBO Pro, HOBO Pendant, and iButton hygrochron) housed in manufactured Gill shields or ad hoc, custom-fabricated shields constructed from everyday materials such as plastic cups. We installed this sensor array (five replicates of 11 sensor-shield combinations) at weather stations located in open and forested sites. HOBO Pro sensors with Gill shields were the most accurate devices, with a mean absolute error of 0.2$^\circ$C relative to weather stations at each site. Error in ad hoc shield treatments ranged from 0.8 to 3.0$^\circ$C, with the largest errors at the open site. We then deployed one replicate of each sensor-shield combination at five sites that varied in the amount of urban impervious surface cover, which presents a further shielding challenge. Bias in sensors paired with ad hoc shields increased by up to 0.7$^\circ$C for every 10\% increase in impervious surface. Our results indicate that, due to variable shielding practices, the ecological literature likely includes highly biased temperature data that cannot be compared directly across studies. If left unaddressed, these errors will hinder efforts to predict biological responses to climate change. We call for greater standardization in how temperature data are recorded in the field, handled in analyses, and reported in publications.},

  abstract = {Adaptive management methods are best for ensuring management goals are met when implementing prescribed fire to areas of fire exclusion. Prior to intense logging and subsequent fire suppression efforts of the early 1900s, longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) woodlands dominated the southeastern United States. As a pyrogenic forest type, natural wildfires occur with a 2-15year fire return interval. Remaining longleaf forests are predominantly second-growth, with current vegetation structure reflecting decades of fire exclusion resulting from continued suppression efforts. Research in longleaf savannas has demonstrated that hardwood encroachment, reduced floristic diversity, and reduced longleaf yearling establishment occurs in the absence of fire. However, few studies have examined the potential role of prescribed fire management in moderating longleaf pine regeneration in second-growth xeric sandhill assemblages. Over a seven year period of fire reintroduction, we examined the effects of prescribed fire on longleaf pine demographics and structure in a forest that experienced a significant reduction in fire frequency during the 20th century. We observed no difference in overstory composition or hardwood density between burned and adjacent unburned areas. Understory woody stem density (DBH2cm) was dominated by juvenile longleaf plants, which likely caused greater variability in light reaching the forest floor in unburned vs. burned areas. Significant shifts in demographic structure were evident in juvenile longleaf plants that initiated height growth following the onset of prescribed fire treatments. Longleaf yearling density (1year old) averaged 5plantsm-2 (unburned 1plantm-2) and was positively correlated with fire frequency. Greater accumulation of leaf litter in unburned (10cm) vs. burned areas (5cm) likely influenced yearling recruitment, as expected given the species' need for contact with bare mineral soil for germination. Unlike pine savannas where reduction of hardwoods is often the target of management, intraspecific interactions (i.e. negative density dependence) likely play a greater role in successful longleaf recruitment and population demography in this sandhill assemblage. This study further highlights the utility of implementing and observing a range of fire applications when reintroducing fire to long unburned systems.},

  abstract = {Controlling broadleaf woody plant abundance is one of the greatest challenges in longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) ecosystem restoration. Numerous factors have been associated with broadleaf woody plant abundance in longleaf pine ecosystems, including site quality, stand structure, and fire frequency and intensity, yet the way in which these factors vary and interact across a landscape is poorly understood. The goal of this study was to quantify the importance of environmental and management factors and their interactions on the abundance of hardwood tree and shrub species in upland pine forests managed for longleaf pine restoration in Fort Benning, GA. We measured understory, midstory, and overstory vegetation in 189 fixed-area plots, and we assembled descriptive plot data about soil texture classes, slope and aspect, and fire management history. We used classification and regression trees to model broadleaf woody species abundance. Regression trees identified fire return interval, soil texture, and slope as the most important factors affecting understory woody plant cover, with high mean cover occurring in areas with longer fire return intervals (i.e. less frequent fire), on fine-textured soils (sandy clay loams and sandy loams), and on slopes less than 6\%. An interaction between soil texture and fire return interval was present and suggested that frequent fire was especially important in controlling understory broadleaf woody plants on fine-textured soils. A significant interaction emerged between soil texture and pine basal area as well, suggesting that the potential to release woody competitors with canopy removal was higher on fine-textured soils than on coarse-textured soils. The presence of hardwood stems in the midstory was most dependent upon time since burn. Other factors, such as the number of burns conducted during the growing season and topographic aspect, did not contribute significantly to variation in woody plant cover or density. Of the woody species encountered, sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua L.) was the most abundant, especially on plots with fire return intervals $\geq$2.6years, on fine-textured soils, and at low pine basal areas (9.4m2/ha). Other species such as persimmon (Diospyros virginiana L.), winged sumac (Rhus copallinum L.), and southern red oak (Quercus falcata Michx.) were commonly encountered but at low densities. Our results demonstrate the general complexity of woody species control, but more importantly indicate site differences that could be used to prioritize prescribed fire application at the landscape scale.},

Whether patterns found can be extrapolated to complex, nonexperimental, real-world landscapes that provide ecosystem services to humans remains unclear. Here, we combine species inventories from a large-scale network of 447 1-km(2) plots with remotely sensed indices of primary productivity (years 2000-2015). We show that landscape-scale productivity and its temporal stability increase with the diversity of plants and other taxa. Effects of biodiversity indicators on productivity were comparable in size to effects of other important drivers related to climate, topography, and land cover. These effects occurred in plots that integrated different ecosystem types (i.e., metaecosystems) and were consistent over vast environmental and altitudinal gradients. The BEF relations we report are as strong or even exceed the ones found in small-scale experiments, despite different community assembly processes and a species pool comprising nearly 2,000 vascular plant species. Growing season length increased progressively over the observation period, and this shift was accelerated in more diverse plots, suggesting that a large species pool is important for adaption to climate change. Our study further implies that abiotic global-change drivers may mediate ecosystem functioning through biodiversity changes.},

  abstract = {Prescribed fire is widely used to manage fuels in high-frequency, low-severity fire regimes including pine flatwoods of the southeastern USA where prescribed burning during the growing season (the frost-free period during the calendar year) has become more common in recent decades. Growing season prescribed fires address ecological management objectives that focus on increasing herb cover and decreasing shrub cover. The shift from shrub to herb dominance due to burning in the growing season corresponds to a change in surface fuels that could affect fire behavior, yet little has been done to assess the potential effects. We examined the effects of season-of-burn on shrub and herbaceous fuel layers and predicted fire behavior at replicate plots on frequently burned mesic pine flatwoods for two season-of-burn treatments (growing and dormant season prescribed fires) in two geographic regions in northern Florida. The Fuel Characteristic Classification System was used to construct a representative fuelbed for each plot at each sampling time to predict fire behavior. Predicted fire behavior was tested for correlation with measured surface fuel properties to determine if there was an effect from differences in fuels characteristics across treatments. In addition, fire temperature was measured in situ as a proxy for fire intensity and tested for treatment effects on the re-growth of live surface fuels. Compared to single dormant season burns, our single growing season burns caused no changes to live understory fuels and had no detectable effect on fire behavior, although predicted rate of spread and flame length were significantly reduced after all prescribed burns. Shrub cover and predicted fire behavior were, however, significantly different between geographic regions, and shrub height was significantly affected by fire temperature. Predicted fire behavior was strongly correlated with measures of the litter and herb strata. Results from this study suggest that land managers should not initially expect large changes in understory fuel properties or potential fire behavior from a shift to burning during the growing season and show that geographic location and fire intensity had significant effects on live fuels and potential fire behavior.},

We first investigate issues related to its definition as a set of local communities that are linked by dispersal of multiple potentially interacting species. We then identify four paradigms for metacommunities: the patch-dynamic view, the species-sorting view, the mass effects view and the neutral view, that each emphasizes different processes of potential importance in metacommunities. These have somewhat distinct intellectual histories and we discuss elements related to their potential future synthesis. We then use this framework to discuss why the concept is useful in modifying existing ecological thinking and illustrate this with a number of both theoretical and empirical examples. As ecologists strive to understand increasingly complex mechanisms and strive to work across multiple scales of spatio-temporal organization, concepts like the metacommunity can provide important insights that frequently contrast with those that would be obtained with more conventional approaches based on local communities alone.},

  abstract = {Fire is integral to the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems of the southeastern USA and is a strong selective force on plant species. Among woody plants, oak species (Quercus spp. L) have diverse life history traits that appear to reflect their evolution in this fire-prone region. Oaks also occur across wide gradients of fire frequency and intensity, from annually burned savannas to fire-protected forests. As such, oak functional traits are presumed to reflect adaptations to acquire limited resources (i.e., ``physiological traits'') or survive environmental stress (i.e., ``protective traits''). Oak functional traits may also influence fire regimes (i.e., via ``flammability traits'') by altering fire behavior through effects on fuels and their combustion. We synthesized evidence from ecophysiological measurements, laboratory burning and drying experiments, and field experiments to determine the suites of functional traits that reflect fire adaptive strategies in eight Southeastern oaks for which abundant data were available. We found strong correlations among Principal Components Analysis axes for flammability (litter burning and drying), protective (bark and wound responses), and physiological (growth) traits. The eight oaks clustered into three strategies: 1) pyrophytic species that produce highly flammable leaf litter, accrue thick bark rapidly, close wounds rapidly, and grow slowly; 2) mesophytic species that produce low flammability litter, have thin bark, and are fast growing; and 3) fire-avoider species with a mixture of traits from the two extremes. This synthesis clarifies the relative pyrophily of Southeastern oaks and suggests how suites of fire-related traits influence fire regimes and species habitat preferences.},

  abstract = {It is argued that the problem of pattern and scale is the central problem in ecology, unifying population biology and ecosystems science, and marrying basic and applied ecology. Applied challenges, such as the prediction of the ecological causes and consequences of global climate change, require the interfacing of phenomena that occur on very different scales of space, time, and ecological organization. Furthermore, there is no single natural scale at which ecological phenomena should be studied; systems generally show characteristic variability on a range of spatial, temporal, and organizational scales. The observer imposes a perceptual bias, a filter through which the system is viewed. This has fundamental evolutionary significance, since every organism is an "observer" of the environment, and life history adaptations such as dispersal and dormancy alter the perceptual scales of the species, and the observed variability. It likewise has fundamental significance for our own study of ecological systems, since the patterns that are unique to any range of scales will have unique causes and biological consequences. The key to prediction and understanding lies in the elucidation of mechanisms underlying observed patterns. Typically, these mechanisms operate at different scales than those on which the patterns are observed; in some cases, the patterns must be understood as emerging from the collective behaviors of large ensembles of smaller scale units. In other cases, the pattern is imposed by larger scale constraints. Examination of such phenomena requires the study of how pattern and variability change with the scale of description, and the development of laws for simplification, aggregation, and scaling. Examples are given from the marine and terrestrial literatures.},

  abstract = {In the UK, Acute Oak Decline (AOD) has caused much concern, due to its distinctive symptoms and its potential to impact oak species that form the largest component of native broadleaf woodland. Decline complexes involve multiple biotic and abiotic factors, which combine to reduce host vigor. In order to investigate forest decline, it is necessary to take a systems approach by considering biotic agents and their interactions with environmental factors, as unfavorable conditions may predispose host trees to pests and diseases. AOD affected trees have lesions in the phloem caused by necrogenic bacteria associated with galleries of the two-spotted oak buprestid (Agrilus biguttatus). Here, we test the extent to which AOD is influenced by environmental predisposition factors traditionally associated with oak decline. These are often factors that reduce water availability. During 2013 and 2014 extensive surveys were undertaken, which systematically visited oak woodlands across England and Wales. These locations were used in conjunction with reports from landowners, which have been collected from 2006 onwards. In total 544 locations have been used to assess relationships with soil type, climatic factors and pollutant deposition, notably atmospheric nitrogen, using logistic regression models. The resulting model has been used to produce a detailed risk map for England and Wales and predictions have been validated using the locations of an independent dataset of A. biguttatus sightings collected by entomologists. This spatial study re-emphasises the importance of predisposition factors in decline syndromes and suggests avenues for future management and mitigation.},

  abstract = {Tropical grasses fuel the majority of fires on Earth. In fire-prone landscapes, enhanced flammability may be adaptive for grasses via the maintenance of an open canopy and an increase in spatiotemporal opportunities for recruitment and regeneration. In addition, by burning intensely but briefly, high flammability may protect resprouting buds from lethal temperatures. Despite these potential benefits of high flammability to fire-prone grasses, variation in flammability among grass species, and how trait differences underpin this variation, remains unknown. By burning leaves and plant parts, we experimentally determined how five plant traits (biomass quantity, biomass density, biomass moisture content, leaf surface-area-to-volume ratio and leaf effective heat of combustion) combined to determine the three components of flammability (ignitability, sustainability and combustibility) at the leaf and plant scales in 25 grass species of fire-prone South African grasslands at a time of peak fire occurrence. The influence of evolutionary history on flammability was assessed based on a phylogeny built here for the study species. Grass species differed significantly in all components of flammability. Accounting for evolutionary history helped to explain patterns in leaf-scale combustibility and sustainability. The five measured plant traits predicted components of flammability, particularly leaf ignitability and plant combustibility in which 70\% and 58\% of variation, respectively, could be explained by a combination of the traits. Total above-ground biomass was a key driver of combustibility and sustainability with high biomass species burning more intensely and for longer, and producing the highest predicted fire spread rates. Moisture content was the main influence on ignitability, where species with higher moisture contents took longer to ignite and once alight burnt at a slower rate. Biomass density, leaf surface-area-to-volume ratio and leaf effective heat of combustion were weaker predictors of flammability components. Synthesis. We demonstrate that grass flammability is predicted from easily measurable plant functional traits and is influenced by evolutionary history with some components showing phylogenetic signal. Grasses are not homogenous fuels to fire. Rather, species differ in functional traits that in turn demonstrably influence flammability. This diversity is consistent with the idea that flammability may be an adaptive trait for grasses of fire-prone ecosystems.},

The main objective of the present study was to provide experimental measurements to test such models. An apparatus was designed to simulate and study in laboratory conditions the flame and the near-field plume stemming from the combustion of an isolated shrub. The burner was made of a cylindrical wire mesh basket filled with a forest fuel ignited at the lower circumference of the basket. Three diameters (20, 28, and 40 cm) for the basket and two kinds of fuel (Pinus pinaster needles and excelsior) were used. Temperatures were measured inside and above the burner using type K thermocouples of 50-$\mu$m diameter. Three pairs of these sensors were especially used to estimate the upward gas velocity, thanks to the expected cross-correlation of thermal fluctuations. We obtained varied and non-steady regimes of combustion as desired, in particular the maximum heat release rates ranged between 30 and 180 kW. The structure of the visible flame and its temperatures were analyzed for a fully developed flame. The height of a flame was found to scale with the heat release rate according to the usual two-fifths power law, which enables a normalized flame height to be defined. Vertical temperature profiles in the flame were found to scale with the normalized height and radial temperature profiles fitted Gaussian laws well. The determination of gas velocity was uncertain, but the usual scaling also applied to the measurements. Scaling rules, which apply well to either steady turbulent diffusion flames on a porous gas burner or pool fires, hold for the non-steady flame on our forest fuel burner, when observing a fully developed flame. \textcopyright{} 2003 The Combustion Institute.

  abstract = {Frequently burned low-latitude coniferous forests maintain a high-diversity understory. Longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) forests and woodlands have exceptionally high diversity at fine scales and very frequent fire return intervals (1\textendash{}3 yr). Furthermore, the positive association between high-frequency, low-intensity surface fires and high species richness in longleaf pine ecosystems is well documented but poorly understood. Recent studies have demonstrated additional linkages between specific fuel assemblages and fire intensity at small spatial scales. In this study, we build upon both patterns by using long-term datasets to examine the relationship between fire and specific fuel types, and how the combination of these two elements contributes to ground cover species diversity. We used 11 yr of monitoring data from longleaf pine forests at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida (USA), to parameterize a structural equation model that examines causal relationships between fuels and fire history on ground cover plant diversity. Overstory-derived fuels, including pine needle litter, pine cones, and other 10 and 100-h woody fuels, had the greatest positive impact on diversity in relatively open-canopied, frequently burned reference stands. A second model examined surface fuel components originating from the forest overstory as characterized by airborne light detection and ranging and found that pine needle litter was positively associated with canopy density. Our parameter estimates for causal relationships between easily measured variables and plant diversity will allow for the development of management models at the stand scale while being informed by fuels measured at the plot scale.},

Here we synthesize the literature on trophic cascades initiated by infectious agents including parasitoids, pathogens, parasitic castrators, macroparasites, and trophically transmitted parasites. Like predators, infectious agents can cause density-mediated and trait-mediated indirect effects through their direct consumptive and nonconsumptive effects respectively. Unlike most predators, however, infectious agents are not fully and immediately lethal to their victims, so their consumptive effects can also trigger trait-mediated indirect effects. We find that the frequency of trophic cascades reported for different consumer types scales with consumer lethality. Furthermore, we emphasize the value of uniting predator-prey and parasite-host theory under a general consumer-resource framework. Trophic cascades originate with consumers (predators or infectious agents).The frequency of trophic cascades reported for different consumer types scales with consumer lethality.Unlike most predators, infectious agents can consume (i.e., infect) a victim without killing it. This raises the potential for infectious agents to cause consumptive trait-mediated indirect effects, which can be positive or negative.Infectious agents seem less likely than predators to cause consumptive density-mediated indirect effects and nonconsumptive trait-mediated indirect effects, but are uniquely capable of causing consumptive trait-mediated indirect effects.Unification of predator-prey and parasite-host theory under a general consumer-resource framework will benefit both fields.},

  abstract = {Fire ecology has been hindered by the lack of comparable, affordable protocols to quantify the flammability of whole plants over large numbers of species.We describe a low-tech device that can be carried to the field and that allows highly standardized measurement of the flammability of whole individuals or portions up to 70 cm long.We illustrate its potential with results for 34 species belonging to different growth forms from central Argentina. The device consists of an 85 \textyen{} 60 cm half-cut metallic barrel placed horizontally and mounted on a removable metallic structure. It contains three parallel burners, a grill with an attached gauging thermometer and a blowtorch. Burners and blowtorch are connected to a propane\textendash{}butane gas cylinder. Plant samples are placed on the grill and preheated with the burners for 2 min at 150$^\circ$C.They are then ignited for 10 s with the blowtorch while the burners are kept on. Four parameters are measured for each sample: maximum temperature reached, burning time, burnt length and burnt biomass percentage. These parameters are used to construct a compound index of flammability for each sample that ranges between 0 (no flammability) and around 3 (maximum flammability).We obtained a wide range of values for flammability and all its components. Most of this variability was accounted for by differences between growth forms and species, rather than by differences at the level of replicates.This suggests that the device and protocol are sensitive enough to detect flammability differences among plants with different functional traits, and at the same time robust enough to produce consistent results among samples with similar traits. A major advantage is that plant architecture is kept almost intact, providing a flammability measure much closer to that of whole individuals in the field than those obtained by other standard protocols in use.The device and protocol presented here should facilitate the acquisition of comparable flammability data over large numbers of species from different floras and ecosystems, potentially contributing to several fields of research, such as functional ecology, evolutionary ecology and vegetation-atmosphere modelling.

In this review, we outline some of the current understanding of the processes by which climate/meteorology controls wildfire behavior by focusing on four critical stages of wildfire development: (1) fuel drying, (2) ignition, (3) spread, and (4) extinction. We identify some key mechanisms that are required for predicting climate change effects on fires, as well as gaps in our understanding of the processes linking climate and fires. It is currently not possible to make accurate predictions of climate change effects on wildfires due to the limited understanding of the linkage between general circulation model outputs and the local-scale meteorology to which fire behavior processes respond.

Cross-validation, involving repeated splits of each data set into training and validation subsets, was used to obtain honest estimates of predictive ability that could be fairly compared among methods. There was surprisingly little difference in predictive ability among five methods based on multiple linear regression. Stepwise methods performed similarly to exhaustive algorithms for subset selection, and the choice of criterion for comparing models (Akaike's information criterion, Schwarz's Bayesian information criterion or F statistics) had little effect on predictive ability. For most of the data sets, two methods based on regression trees yielded models with substantially lower predictive ability. I argue that there is no 'best' method of variable selection and that any of the regression-based approaches discussed here is capable of yielding useful predictive models.},

In spite of the significance of the selected models, they vary substantially between years and suggest patterns that are at odds with those determined by analysing the full, 4-year data set.$\backslash$n* 4An information theoretic (IT) analysis of the yellowhammer data set illustrates why the varying outcomes of stepwise analyses arise. In particular, the IT approach identifies large numbers of competing models that could describe the data equally well, showing that no one model should be relied upon for inference.},

  abstract = {Fire is an important ecological disturbance in vegetated ecosystems across the globe, and also has considerable impacts on human infrastructure. Vegetation flammability is a key bottom-up control on fire regimes and on the nature of individual fires. Although New Zealand (NZ) historically had low fire frequencies, anthropogenic fires have considerably impacted indigenous vegetation as humans used fire extensively to clear forests. Few studies of vegetation flammability have been undertaken in NZ and only one has compared the flammability of indigenous plants; this was a qualitative assessment derived from expert opinion. We addressed this knowledge gap by measuring the flammability of terminal shoots from a range of trees and shrubs found in NZ. We quantified shoot flammability of 60 indigenous and exotic species, and compared our experimentally derived ranking with expert opinion. The most flammable species was the invasive exotic shrub Gorse (Ulex europaeus), followed by Manna Gum (Eucalyptus viminalis), K (u) over bar marahou (Pomaderris kumeraho), Rimu (Dacrydium cupressinum) and Silver Beech (Lophozonia menziesii). Our experimentally derived ranking was strongly correlated with expert opinion, lending support to both methods. Our results are useful to ecologists seeking to understand how fires have and will influence NZ's ecosystems, and for fire managers identifying high-risk landscapes, and low flammability species for green firebreaks'.},

Rather than report device temperatures that are not generally comparable among studies, we show that maximum and time-integrated temperatures of relatively thick (4.8 mm diameter) type-K thermocouple probes (TCPs) can be calibrated to estimate fuel consumption and fire line intensity in surface fires. Although reporting standard fire characteristics is an improvement over reporting device temperatures, TCPs are not ideal instruments for monitoring surface fires, because they provide only point estimates of fire behaviour and must be calibrated for different fire environments, TCP characteristics, and deployments. To illustrate how TCPs respond to fires and to point the way towards a more general calibration method, we report results from a numerical model that accurately simulated TCP response to a spreading surface fire in mixed oak (Quercus spp.) forest litter and woody fuels.},

We used a natural gradient to examine how plant species richness and plant community structure vary with standing crop biomass (which in this system is proportional to annual net productivity) as a function of soil moisture and nitrogen mineralization rates in a frequently burned longleaf pine-wiregrass savanna. Highest ground cover biomass and highest species richness were found at the same position along the gradient, the wet-mesic sites. Relative differences in species richness among site types were independent of scale, ranging from 0.01 m(2) to 100 m(2). Nitrogen availability was negatively correlated with species richness. Dominance of wiregrass (in terms of biomass) was consistent across the gradient and not correlated with species richness. Regardless of site type, the community structure of the savannas was characterized by many perennial species with infrequent occurrences, a factor in the low temporal heterogeneity (percent similarity between seasons and years) and high within-site spatial heterogeneity (percent dissimilarity of vegetation composition). The coexistence of numerous species is likely due to the high frequency of fire that removes competing hardwood vegetation and litter and to the suite of fire-adapted perennial species that, once established, are able to persist. Our results suggest that soil moisture is an important factor regulating both the number of species present and community production within the defined gradient of this study.},

Callitris intratropica is a fire-sensitive conifer that is widespread across northern Australia, but its range is contracting because of frequent and intense fires. * A small-scale field experiment was used to compare the effect of three fuel types (grass, eucalypt litter and C. intratropica litter), and a mix of grass and eucalypt litter by varying fuel loads within their naturally occurring bounds, and measuring multiple flammability attributes. * Fuel type had the strongest influence on flammability attributes and hence sapling survival. Grass burnt rapidly, producing high temperatures, while duration of flaming was longer for eucalypt litter. Grass\textendash{}eucalypt litter mixtures had flammability attributes more like grass, while C. intratropica litter was difficult to burn. Fuel load had a secondary effect, with strong interactions between fuel type and load. * Differences in sapling survival could be attributed to temperatures at 5 cm height; there was no additional effect of fuel type or canopy temperature. Sapling size variables were also important, and strongly correlated with bark thickness, so we could not identify the protective mechanism. * Synthesis. Mortality of Callitris intratropica saplings was consistent with damage to the lower stem, because of the direct relationship with temperatures at 5 cm height. Our results demonstrate the existence of a grass\textendash{}fire cycle in C. intratropica stands, whereby hot fires damage the stands and allow grass to invade, increasing the stand ignitability and combustibility and promoting further fires. Interrupting this cycle by reducing grass fuel loads and hence the frequency of hot fires should therefore be a management priority to safeguard C. intratropica populations. Our findings also highlight that, under a common climate, vegetation type can shape fire regimes, because fuel type strongly influences flammability attributes, which in turn act as a powerful filter of plant populations.},

  abstract = {Non-native grass invasions have the potential to change natural and prescribed fire regimes by altering fuels, which in turn may promote further invasion. We examined if invasion by Microstegium vimineum, a non-native annual grass, resulted in a positive invasion-fire feedback in eastern deciduous forests managed with prescribed fire and how this response varied across the landscape. Using paired invaded and uninvaded plots embedded in forest stands subjected to prescribed fire, we quantified differences in fire intensity and fuel loads, and fire effects on M. vimineum seedbank emergence, performance and spread. Invaded sites had less leaf litter and fine woody fuels, and increased fire intensity. Although fire reduced emergence of M. vimineum from the soil seedbank, sites subjected to prescribed fire had greater M. vimineum biomass and higher recruitment than unburned sites. Soil moisture strongly modulated M. vimineum response to fire, such that fire facilitated M. vimineum invasion more in wetter than drier sites. These findings indicate that deciduous forests are vulnerable to positive invasion-fire feedbacks, although the positive effect of fire may be less pronounced where soil moisture is limiting. The interaction between soil moisture and fire effects can inform management decisions regarding where to combine prescribed burning with intensive invasive control measures such as torching, hand pulling, and herbicide application.},

Interestingly, the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta Buren, is found predominantly in disturbed habitats, such as burned habitats, and studies have reported that red imported fire ants prey on lone star ticks. To better understand drivers of tick population differences in burned habitats, the current study was conducted to evaluate the effects of red imported fire ant and habitat on survival of lone star and Gulf Coast ticks. Within treatments (burned habitat with red imported fire ants, burned habitat without red imported fire ants, and unburned habitat without red imported fire ants), 10 tick enclosures were installed and seeded with engorged lone star or Gulf Coast tick nymphs. After molting, ticks within enclosures were collected. Survival of lone star ticks in burned habitats (regardless of red imported fire ant presence) was significantly lower compared with unburned habitat. Gulf Coast ticks had significantly greater survival in burned habitats (regardless of red imported fire ant presence) compared with lone star ticks. In this study, burning status was more important for survival of ticks than presence of red imported fire ants, with Gulf Coast ticks surviving better in burned habitat that typically experiences higher temperatures and lower humidity.},

(Acari: Ixodidae) dominated the tick population while Ixodes scapularis Say was not encountered. There were complex differences in tick populations among site conditions. After prescribed burning, the tick population size was small but was larger in subsequent 2- and 5-year post-burn sites. An increase in Odocoileus virginianus foraging in recently burned sites is likely responsible for this phenomenon. WUI areas had the largest tick populations likely due to Odocoileus virginianus activity in an area that provides cover, forage, and a connection to a wildlife refuge. It is possible that the likelihood of humans coming in contact with ticks and tick-borne diseases is greater in WUI areas than in unbroken contiguous forest. A. americanum showed a positive correlation with percent cover of grass and leaf litter mass and a negative relationship with pine sapling density. Variables expected to be strongly correlated with A. americanum populations such as soil moisture, canopy closure, and tree density were found to have weak correlations.},

To determine the prevalence of this tick and associated microbes in North Central Florida state parks, $\sim$1,500 lone star tick specimens were collected between 2010 and 2012 analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) sequencing. Additionally, 393 white-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus (Zimmerman), samples were analyzed for pathogen prevalence using molecular methods and serology. In lone star ticks, 14.6, 15.6, and 57.1\% were positive for E. chaffeensis, E. ewingii, and Rickettsia spp. DNA, respectively. Panola Mountain Ehrlichia or B. lonestari DNA were each detected in nearly 2\% of tick specimens. In white-tailed deer, 7.3\% were PCR positive for E. chaffeensis, 6.0\% for E. ewingii, and 3.2\% for rickettsial species. Approximately 45\% of white-tailed deer specimens had antibodies to Ehrlichia spp., and 1\% had antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi In summary, E. chaffeensis, E. ewingii, and spotted fever group rickettsia are highly prevalent in host-seeking lone star ticks and in white-tailed deer in Florida.

  abstract = {Fire seasonality, an important characteristic of fire regimes, commonly is delineated using seasons based on single weather variables (rainfall or temperature). We used nonparametric cluster analyses of a 17-year (1993-2009) data set of weather variables that influence likelihoods and spread of fires (relative humidity, air temperature, solar radiation, wind speed, soil moisture) to explore seasonality of fire in pine savanna-grassland landscapes at the Avon Park Air Force Range in southern Florida. A four-variable, three-season model explained more variation within fire weather variables than models with more seasons. The three-season model also delineated intra-annual timing of fire more accurately than a conventional rainfall-based two-season model. Two seasons coincided roughly with dry and wet seasons based on rainfall. The third season, which we labeled the fire season, occurred between dry and wet seasons and was characterized by fire-promoting conditions present annually: drought, intense solar radiation, low humidity, and warm air temperatures. Fine fuels consisting of variable combinations of pyrogenic pine needles, abundant C4 grasses, and flammable shrubs, coupled with low soil moisture, and lightning ignitions early in the fire season facilitate natural landscape-scale wildfires that burn uplands and across wetlands. We related our three season model to fires with different ignition sources (lightning, military missions, and prescribed fires) over a 13-year period with fire records (1997-2009). Largest wildfires originate from lightning and military ignitions that occur within the early fire season substantially prior to the peak of lightning strikes in the wet season. Prescribed ignitions, in contrast, largely occur outside the fire season. Our delineation of a pronounced fire season provides insight into the extent to which different human-derived fire regimes mimic lightning fire regimes. Delineation of a fire season associated with timing of natural lightning ignitions should be useful as a basis for ecological fire management of humid savanna-grassland landscapes worldwide.},

  abstract = {Seasonality drives ecological processes through networks of forcings, and the resultant complexity requires creative approaches for modeling to be successful. Recently ecologists and climatologists have developed sophisticated methods for fully describing seasons. However, to date the relationships among the variables produced by these methods have not been analyzed as networks, but rather with simple univariate statistics. In this manuscript we used structural equation modeling (SEM) to analyze a proposed causal network describing seasonality of rainfall for a site in south-central Florida. We also described how this network was influenced by the El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and how the network in turn affected the site's wildfire regime. Our models indicated that wet and dry seasons starting later in the year (or ending earlier) were shorter and had less rainfall. El Ni\~no conditions increased dry season rainfall, and via this effect decreased the consistency of that season's drying trend. El Ni\~no conditions also negatively influenced how consistent the moistening trend was during the wet season, but in this case the effect was direct and did not route through rainfall. In modeling wildfires, our models showed that area burned was indirectly influenced by ENSO via its effect on dry season rainfall. Area burned was also indirectly reduced when the wet season had consistent rainfall, as such wet seasons allowed fewer wildfires in subsequent fire seasons. Overall area burned at the study site was estimated with high accuracy (R (2) score = 0.63). In summary, we found that by using SEMs, we were able to clearly describe causal patterns involving seasonal climate, ENSO and wildfire. We propose that similar approaches could be effectively applied to other sites where seasonality exerts strong and complex forcings on ecological processes.},

  abstract = {"Fire regime" has become, in recent decades, a key concept in many scientific domains. In spite of its wide spread use, the concept still lacks a clear and wide established definition. Many believe that it was first discussed in a famous report on national park management in the United States, and that it may be simply defined as a selection of a few measurable parameters that summarize the fire occurrence patterns in an area. This view has been uncritically perpetuated in the scientific community in the last decades. In this paper we attempt a historical reconstruction of the origin, the evolution and the current meaning of "fire regime" as a concept. Its roots go back to the 19th century in France and to the first half of the 20th century in French African colonies. The "fire regime" concept took time to evolve and pass from French into English usage and thus to the whole scientific community. This coincided with a paradigm shift in the early 1960s in the United States, where a favourable cultural, social and scientific climate led to the natural role of fires as a major disturbance in ecosystem dynamics becoming fully acknowledged. Today the concept of "fire regime" refers to a collection of several fire-related parameters that may be organized, assembled and used in different ways according to the needs of the users. A structure for the most relevant categories of parameters is proposed, aiming to contribute to a unified concept of "fire regime" that can reconcile the physical nature of fire with the socio-ecological context within which it occurs.},

This may be due to the fact that ecological change and disease emergence are often mediated through complex and large-scale processes that are not amenable to traditional reductionist approaches to causal inference. Here, we suggest strategies assembled from diverse disciplines, including ecology, epidemiology, and the social sciences, to analyze complex relationships, promote cooperation, increase efficiency, and minimize bias when investigating the ecological drivers of disease emergence. These techniques, which complement traditional hypothesis testing, includeepidemiologic causal criteria, strong inference, causal diagrams, model selection, and triangulation. We alsopresent several examples from recent emerging infectious disease investigations, including Hendra virus, Nipahvirus, coral diseases, and avian influenza, where these techniques were successfully applied. Here, we outline some of the barriers to advancing our understanding of causation in disease ecology and offer some solutions for investigating large-scale ecological drivers, such as global warming, pollution, and land-use change.},

  abstract = {The California spotted owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) has been at the center of political and administrative debate due to its association with commercially valuable forest. Several studies have compared the forest cover types used by California spotted owls with the cover types that are generally available, establishing the association between spotted owls and old/large tree components of forests at the landscape scale. We sought a deeper understanding of spotted owl habitat associations in areas in which owls had already selected territories. We mapped and classified vegetation within circular plots (radius 2.4 km) around 67 spotted owl sites in northeastern California, USA. We evaluated the relationships between habitat composition within the different owl sites and variation in (1) nest success (1990\textendash{}2000) and (2) site occupancy, apparent survival probability, and reproductive output (1993\textendash{}1998). All analyses included data representing 2 spatial scales: core area (814 ha) and nest area (203 ha). Site occupancy was positively associated with the amount of the nest area dominated by large trees with high canopy cover within the nest area. It was negatively associated with the amount of nonhabitat (nonforested areas and forest cover types not used for nesting or foraging) and with medium-sized trees with high canopy cover. Site occupancy also decreased with time and elevation. Apparent survival probability varied annually and was positively related to the area of each habitat class multiplied by the quotient proportion used/proportion available for each type, at both the nest and core scales. Reproductive output was negatively related to elevation and nonhabitat within the nest area. Nest success was positively associated with the presence of large remnant trees within the nest stand.},

  abstract = {Plant invasions are known to have negative impacts on native plant communities, yet their influence on higher trophic levels has not been well documented. Past studies investigating the effects of invasive plants on herbivores and carnivores have been largely observational in nature and thus lack the ability to tease apart whether differences are a cause or consequence of the invasion. In addition, understanding how plant traits and plant species compositions change in invaded habitats may increase our ability to predict when and where invasive plants will have effects that cascade to animals. To assess effects on arthropods, we experimentally introduced a non-native plant (Microstegium vimineum, Japanese stiltgrass) in a community re-assembly experiment. We also investigated possible mechanisms through which the invader could affect associated arthropods, including changes in native plant species richness, above-ground plant biomass, light availability and vegetation height. In experimentally invaded plots, arthropod abundance was reduced by 39\%, and species richness declined by 19\%. Carnivores experienced greater reductions in abundance than herbivores (61\% vs 31\% reduction). Arthropod composition significantly diverged between experimentally invaded and control plots, and particular species belonging to the abundant families Aphididae (aphids), Formicidae (ants) and Phalacridae (shining flower beetles) contributed the most to compositional differences. Among the mechanisms we investigated, only the reduction in native plant species richness caused by invasion was strongly correlated with total arthropod abundance and richness. In sum, our results demonstrate negative impacts of M. vimineum invasion on higher trophic levels and suggest that these effects occur, in part, indirectly through invader-mediated reductions in the richness of the native plant community. The particularly strong response of carnivores suggests that plant invasion could reduce top-down control of herbivorous species for native plants.},

One way invasions can affect native ecosystems is by changing fuel properties, which can in turn affect fire behavior and, ultimately, alter fire regime characteristics such as frequency, intensity, extent, type, and seasonality of fire. If the regime changes subsequently promote the dominance of the invaders, then an invasive plant-fire regime cycle can be established. As more ecosystem components and interactions are altered, restoration of preinvasion conditions becomes more difficult. Restoration may require managing fuel conditions, fire regimes, native plant communities, and other ecosystem properties in addition to the invaders that caused the changes in the first place. We present a multiphase model describing the interrelationships between plant invaders and fire regimes, provide a system for evaluating the relative effects of invaders and prioritizing them for control, and recommend ways to restore preinvasion fire regime properties.},

In addition, less above-ground biomass of native species was present in areas where N. reynaudiana was present.

Using several large burn units (61-242 ha) within the Ozark ecosystem, I measured the effect of the time elapsed since sites were burned on the density of white-tailed deer and the larval life stage of A. americanum. Larval tick densities were highest in areas that were 2 yr postburn and were 6 times higher than tick densities in control units. Deer densities were highest in sites that were burned in the same year as this study and decreased signi\TH{}cantly with time since burn. These results suggest that intensive use of postburn sites by white-tailed deer may increase the abundance of A. americanum to levels greater than occurs in sites that remain unburned. Thus, fire management, although beneficial in many aspects of ecosystem management, may bear the unintended cost of locally increasing abundance of A. americanum.},

  abstract = {Fire, microhabitat, and their interactions affect Florida scrub ecosystems and their plant species. Concepts of vegetation change in the Florida upland landscape have followed successional theory, with recent models emphasizing the resilience of Florida scrub to fire and the interactive effects of the vegetation and fire regime. We extend these models by incorporating greater complexity in vegetation types and emphasizing that departures from modal fire frequencies may alter vegetation. In particular, fire exclusion leads to structural and compositional changes that, in turn, alter vegetation changes following the reintroduction of fire. Individual species responses to fire can be categorized by the demographic mechanisms of the response (e.g., resprouting, clonal growth, seedling recruitment) and by typical patterns of abundance during fire-free intervals. Various types of scrub differ in these life-history traits. For example, xeric rosemary scrub supports more herbs, more endemics, more specialized species, and more seeders increasing in abundance between fires as compared to less xeric scrubby flatwoods. Several of these species are demonstrated specialists for gaps, which are more abundant and persistent in rosemary scrub than in scrubby flatwoods. In scrubby flatwoods, patterns of species abundance are explainable by time since fire and the presence of gaps, and sprouters are more successful than seeders between fires. In rosemary scrub, where gaps remain long after fire, species abundance patterns reflect only gap abundance, and seeders are especially successful between fires. Because fires create or enlarge gaps that are then closed between fires (especially in less xeric habitats), gap specialists may be sensitive to both fire and microhabitat. Alteration of the modal fire regime is hypothesized to affect the proportion of sprouters and seeders, microsite diversity, and the long-term local persistence of species with different specializations for postfire response and between-fire competitive abilities. Metapopulation dynamics in a landscape patterned by edaphic gradients, a patchy and variable disturbance regime, and small-scale gap dynamics produce varied spatial and temporal patterns in species' abundances.},

  abstract = {Some tick populations have increased dramatically in the past several decades leading to an increase in the incidence and emergence of tick-borne diseases. Management strategies that can effectively reduce tick populations while better understanding regional tick phenology is needed. One promising management strategy is prescribed burning. However, the efficacy of prescribed burning as a mechanism for tick control is unclear because past studies have provided conflicting data, likely due to a failure of some studies to simulate operational management scenarios and/or account for other predictors of tick abundance. Therefore, our study was conducted to increase knowledge of tick population dynamics relative to long-term prescribed fire management. Furthermore, we targeted a region, southwestern Georgia and northwestern Florida (USA), in which little is known regarding tick dynamics so that basic phenology could be determined. Twenty-one plots with varying burn regimes (burned surrounded by burned [BB], burned surrounded by unburned [BUB], unburned surrounded by burned [UBB], and unburned surrounded by unburned [UBUB]) were sampled monthly for two years while simultaneously collecting data on variables that can affect tick abundance (e.g., host abundance, vegetation structure, and micro- and macro-climatic conditions). In total, 47,185 ticks were collected, of which, 99\% were Amblyomma americanum, 0.7\% were Ixodes scapularis, and fewer numbers of Amblyomma maculatum, Ixodes brunneus, and Dermacentor variabilis. Monthly seasonality trends were similar between 2010 and 2011. Long-term prescribed burning consistently and significantly reduced tick counts (overall and specifically for A. americanum and I. scapularis) regardless of the burn regimes and variables evaluated. Tick species composition varied according to burn regime with A. americanum dominating at UBUB, A. maculatum at BB, I. scapularis at UBB, and a more even composition at BUB. These data indicate that regular prescribed burning is an effective tool for reducing tick populations and ultimately may reduce risk of tick-borne disease.},

  abstract = {A 27-month-long study was conducted to compare the impacts of Impereact cylindrica (L.) (Beauv.) and native vegetation competition on the productivity of Pinits taeda (L.) seedlings. In March 2003, 1-year-old pine seedlings were planted in the following treatments: vegetation free (VF), native competition (NC), and I. cylindrica (IQ competition. At the end of the study, only 26\% of the IC seedlings survived, half of what was observed in the NC treatment. The IC seedlings had significantly smaller root collar diameter than the NC seedlings (P  0.0001) after the first growing season and by the end of the third growing season the height and stern volume index were significantly less as well (P  0.0001). After one full growing season, the NC and IC pine seedlings had 21 and 11.5\% of the total biomass of the VF seedlings, respectively. After three growing seasons, the IC pine seedling total biomass was 2.4\% of that of the VF seedlings and 18\% of that of the NC seedlings (P  0.0001). The greatest difference was in the pine needle biomass with the IC pine needle biomass being only 11\% of that of the NC. During the first growing season, the IC pine seedlings maintained the lowest levels of light-saturated net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance. These results may be explained by reduced amounts of foliar nitrogen and water stress that result from L cylindrica competition. The pines in the IC treatment had the lowest total foliar surface area and the lowest specific leaf area, which may explain the reduced productivity. Evidence from this study suggests that L clylindrica competition significantly reduces the productivity and growth of P. taeda seedlings compared with that from native vegetation. FOR.

  abstract = {Invasions of non-native species can suppress biodiversity and alter ecosystem functions, but for many of the most widespread invasive species the mechanisms underlying their invasive success and effects on native species are poorly understood. Here we evaluated the peer-reviewed literature on causes and impacts of invasion by cogongrass (. Imperata cylindrica), one of the most problematic invasive plant species in the southeast US. We assess what is known about why cogongrass is particularly invasive and how it affects native communities and ecosystems, review patterns in research methods employed, and provide a roadmap for future research on cogongrass. Although many studies have focused on the basic biology and management of cogongrass, we found surprisingly few (30) studies that have directly tested mechanisms or impacts of cogongrass invasions. The most commonly tested mechanisms, disturbance and allelopathy, were evaluated 4 and 12 times, respectively, and studies on invasion impacts were limited to five studies total: native plant diversity (2 studies), nitrogen cycling (2), decomposition (1), and fine fuel loads (1). Excluding laboratory studies on allelopathy, 75\% (6/8) of impact studies used observational methods, raising questions about cause and effect. Given the paucity of studies on the ecology of cogongrass invasions, and the need to protect conservation areas from invasions, we urge that research efforts focus on: (1) environmental correlates of distribution and performance, (2) the role of propagule pressure in invasion success, (3) enemy release and post-introduction evolution as mechanisms of invasion, and (4) experimental tests of community and ecosystem impacts of invasions.},

  abstract = {Despite the ubiquity of invasive organisms and their often deleterious effects on native flora and fauna, the consequences of biological invasions for human health and the ecological mechanisms through which they occur are rarely considered. Here we demonstrate that a widespread invasive shrub in North America, Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii), increases human risk of exposure to ehrlichiosis, an emerging infectious disease caused by bacterial pathogens transmitted by the lone star tick (Amblyomma americanum). Using large-scale observational surveys in natural areas across the St. Louis, Missouri region, we found that white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), a preeminent tick host and pathogen reservoir, more frequently used areas invaded by honeysuckle. This habitat preference translated into considerably greater numbers of ticks infected with pathogens in honeysuckle-invaded areas relative to adjacent honeysuckle-uninvaded areas. We confirmed this biotic mechanism using an experimental removal of honeysuckle, which caused a decrease in deer activity and infected tick numbers, as well as a proportional shift in the blood meals of ticks away from deer. We conclude that disease risk is likely to be reduced when honeysuckle is eradicated, and suggest that management of biological invasions may help ameliorate the burden of vector-borne diseases on human health.},

  abstract = {Cogongrass is a highly invasive, perennial grass that is found on all continents, except Antarctica. It continues to spread at an alarming rate in the southeastern United States. Cogongrass has been reported from a wide array of habitats; however, soils from areas where cogongrass grows have never been characterized. Live cogongrass plants, herbarium specimens, and soil samples were collected from 53 cogongrass populations from across the 10 physiographic regions and land use areas in Mississippi. Cogongrass leaf and inflorescence morphology varied among sites, and plants were found in soils varying widely in texture (ranging from 28 to 86\% sand, 3 to 48\% silt, and 6 to 43\% clay), organic matter content (ranging from 0.9 to 5.0\%), pH (ranging from 4.4 to 8.0), and nutrient status: 6 to 190 kg ha-1 (15 to 470 lb A-1) of phosphorus (P), 46 to 734 kg ha-1 of potassium (K), 150 to 7,620 kg ha-1 of calcium (Ca), 26 to 1,090 kg ha-1 of magnesium (Mg), 1 to 190 kg ha-1 of zinc (Zn), 145 to 800 kg ha-1 of estimated sulfur (S) based on organic matter, and 57 to 300 kg ha-1 of sodium (Na). These soil parameters were highly variable among cogongrass populations, even within physiographic regions or land use areas, and encompassed much of the soil physiochemical diversity within the state. Soil characteristics were significantly correlated with leaf length (Ca, K, Mg, P, Zn, and percentage of sand and silt), leaf width (Ca, P, Mg, and percentage of sand and silt), the leaf length-to-width ratio (K and P), inflorescence length (Na, P, and pH), inflorescence width (S, organic matter, and pH), and the inflorescence length-to-width ratio (S and organic matter). These data indicate that cogongrass is able to establish, emerge, grow, and reproduce on a wide array of soils in Mississippi. This ability provides cogongrass an advantage over other plant species that are more limited in the soil types that support their growth. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

I. cylindrica was introduced 1 year after the following treatments were established: a control with no native species, five monocultures, a grass mix treatment, a forb mix treatment, and a 3-species treatment and a 5-species treatment. Monthly cover, final biomass, root length, root length density (RLD) and specific root length (SRL) of all species were determined for one full growing season. There was a significant negative linear relationship between the cover of native species and I. cylindrica (r (2) = 0.59, P = 0.01) and a negative logarithmic relationship between the biomass of native species and I. cylindrica (r (2) = 0.70, P = 0.003). There was no diversity-invasibility relationship. Grasses proved to be the most resistant functional group providing resistance alone and in mixed functional communities. Repeated measures analysis demonstrated that treatments including Andropogon virginicus were the most resistant to invasion over time (P  0.001). Significantly greater root length (P = 0.002), RLD (P = 0.011) and SRL (P  0.001) than all of the native species and I. cylindrica in monocultures and in mixed communities made A. virginicus successful. The root morphology characteristics allowed it to be a great competitor belowground where I. cylindrica was most aggressive. The results suggest that species identity could be more important than species or functional richness in determining community resistance to invasion.},

During 2002-2004, oil Camp Shelby Training Site, MS, we investigated relationships between military activity and establishment and growth of Cogongrass. In areas of soil disturbance from military equipment, vegetative linear growth rates of 7-10 m yr(-1) were recorded on firing points.

Thus, steps to minimize soil disturbance in and near Cogongrass may reduce spread. We examined frequency of Cogongrass infestation and vegetative growth rates for roadside areas along gravel roads subject to at least annual mowing and grading, and dirt tracks receiving infrequent maintenance. Cogongrass spread and establishment oil roadsides did not differ for the two road types (P = 0.116).

Here, we review the recent literature, drawing parallels between fire and herbivores as alternative consumers of vegetation. We point to the common questions, and some surprisingly different answers, that emerge from viewing fire as a globally significant consumer that is analogous to herbivory. \textcopyright{} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

  issn = {10498001},
  doi = {10.1071/WF07049},
  abstract = {Several recent papers have suggested replacing the terminology of fire intensity and fire severity. Part of the problem with fire intensity is that it is sometimes used incorrectly to describe fire effects, when in fact it is justifiably restricted to measures of energy output. Increasingly, the term has created confusion because some authors have restricted its usage to a single measure of energy output referred to as fireline intensity. This metric is most useful in understanding fire behavior in forests, but is too narrow to fully capture the multitude of ways fire energy affects ecosystems. Fire intensity represents the energy released during various phases of a fire, and different metrics such as reaction intensity, fireline intensity, temperature, heating duration and radiant energy are useful for different purposes. Fire severity, and the related term burn severity, have created considerable confusion because of recent changes in their usage. Some authors have justified this by contending that fire severity is defined broadly as ecosystem impacts from fire and thus is open to individual interpretation. However, empirical studies have defined fire severity operationally as the loss of or change in organic matter aboveground and belowground, although the precise metric varies with management needs. Confusion arises because fire or burn severity is sometimes defined so that it also includes ecosystem responses. Ecosystem responses include soil erosion, vegetation regeneration, restoration of community structure, faunal recolonization, and a plethora of related response variables. Although some ecosystem responses are correlated with measures of fire or burn severity, many important ecosystem processes have either not been demonstrated to be predicted by severity indices or have been shown in some vegetation types to be unrelated to severity. This is a critical issue because fire or burn severity are readily measurable parameters, both on the ground and with remote sensing, yet ecosystem responses are of most interest to resource managers.},

Selected plots were harvested to alter the height, load and bulk density of the fuel-bed. Fires were lit from a line and allowed to travel up to 400 m down- wind. Fire-spread was correlated with fuel, weather and fireshape variables using multiple regression techniques. Wind speed had most effect on fire-spread. The influence of the other variables was examined after a model for wind speed and moisture content had been fitted. Fuel load did not influence fire-spread. Fires in natural swards burnt 18\% faster than fires in cut grass, but this increase could not be fully explained by changes in the height or bulk density of the fuel bed. Grass type characterised either by species group or by surface-area- to-volume ratio of the fuel particle, did not appear to significantly icfluence fire-spread. Differences in spread rates between the two grasses were attributed to differ- ences in grass curing. The influence of grass curing appeared to be less than indicated by published models. Models of fire-spread in grasslands currently in use need to be revised. Ignition line length was a significant variable influ- encing fire-spread and this must be taken into consid- eration when using experimental fires to validate theo- retical models or develop empirical models from field observations.},

Mean fire intensities were lowest in summer fires (1225 kW m-1), increased in autumn fires (1724 kW m-1) and highest in winter fires (2314 kW m-1); they were associated with a threefold difference between the mean moisture content of grass fuels in winter (28\%) and summer (88\%). * 4Mean fuel loads increased with post-fire age, from 2964 kg ha-1 on annually burnt plots to 3972 kg ha-1 on biennial, triennial and quadrennial burnt plots (which did not differ significantly), but decreased to 2881 kg ha-1 on sexennial burnt plots. Fuel loads also increased with increasing rainfall over the previous 2 years. * 5Mean fire intensities showed no significant differences between annual burns and burns in the biennial, triennial and quadrennial categories, despite lower fuel loads in annual burns, suggesting that seasonal fuel moisture effects overrode those of fuel load. Mean fire intensity in sexennial burns was less than half that of other burns (638 vs. 1969 kW m-1). * 6We used relationships between season of fire, fuel loads and fire intensity in conjunction with the park's fire records to reconstruct broad fire intensity regimes. Changes in management from regular prescribed burning to `natural' fires over the past four decades have resulted in a decrease in moderate-intensity fires and an increase in high-intensity fires. * 7The highest fire intensities measured in our study (11 000 \textendash{}  17 500 kW m-1) were significantly higher than those previously reported for African savannas, but were similar to those in South American cerrado vegetation. The mean fire intensity for late dry season (winter) fires in our study was less than half that reported for late dry season fires in savannas in northern Australia. * 8Synthesis and applications. Fire intensity has important effects on savanna vegetation, especially on the dynamics of the tree layer. Fire intensity varies with season (because of differences in fuel moisture) as well as with fuel load. Managers of African savannas can manipulate fire intensity by choosing the season of fire, and further by burning in years with higher or lower fuel loads. The basic relationships described here can also be used to enhance fire records, with a view to building a long-term data set for the ongoing assessment of the effectiveness of fire management.},

  abstract = {Small-scale variation in fire intensity and effects may be an important source of environmental heterogeneity in frequently burned plant communities. We hypothesized that variation in fire intensity resulting from local differences in fuel loads produces heterogeneity in pine savanna ground cover by altering shrub abundance. To test this hypothesis, we experimentally manipulated prefire fuel loads to mimic naturally occurring fuel-load heterogeneity associated with branch falls, needle fall near large pines, and animal disturbances in a frequently burned longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) savanna in Louisiana, USA. We applied one of four fuel treatments (unaltered control, fine-fuel removal, fine-fuel addition, wood addition) to each of 540 (1-m2) quadrats prior to growing-season prescribed fires in each of two years (1999 and 2001). In both years fuel addition increased (and fuel removal decreased) fuel consumption and maximum fire temperatures relative to unaltered controls. Fuel addition, particularly wood, increased damage to shrubs, increased shrub mortality, and decreased resprout density relative to controls. We propose that local variation in fire intensity may contribute to maintenance of high species diversity in pine savannas by reducing shrub abundance and creating openings in an otherwise continuous ground cover.},

  abstract = {Recent reports suggest that host-seeking nymphs in southern populations of Ixodes scapu-laris remain below the leaf litter surface, while northern nymphs seek hosts on leaves and twigs above the litter surface. This behavioral difference potentially results in decreased tick contact with humans in the south, and fewer cases of Lyme disease. We studied whether north-south differences in tick survival patterns might contribute to this phenomenon. Four month old larvae resulting from a cross between Wisconsin males and South Carolina females died faster under southern than under northern conditions in the lab, as has previ-ously been reported for ticks from both northern and southern populations. However, newly-emerged larvae from Rhode Island parents did not differ consistently in mortality under northern and southern conditions, possibly because of their younger age. Survival is lower, and so the north-south survival difference might be greater in older ticks. Larval survival was positively related to larval size (as measured by scutal area), while survival was positively related to larval fat content in some, but not all, trials. The difference in larval survival under northern vs. southern conditions might simply result from faster metabolism under warmer southern conditions leading to shorter life spans. However, ticks consistently died faster under southern than under northern conditions in the laboratory when relative humidity was low (75\%), but not under moderate (85\%) or high (95\%) RH. Therefore, mortality due to des-iccation stress is greater under southern than under northern conditions. We hypothesize that mortality resulting from the greater desiccation stress under southern conditions acts as a selective pressure resulting in the evolution of host-seeking behavior in which immatures remain below the leaf litter surface in southern I. scapularis populations, so as to avoid the desiccating conditions at the surface. If this hypothesis is correct, it has implications for the effect of climate change on the future distribution of Lyme disease.},

Here we investigated how host density affects the composition of soil pathogen communities and consequently influences the strength of plant-soil feedbacks. In field censuses of six 1-ha permanent plots, we found that survival was much lower for newly germinated seedlings that were surrounded by more conspecific adults. The relative abundance of pathogenic fungi in soil increased with increasing conspecific tree density for five of nine tree species; more soil pathogens accumulated around roots where adult tree density was higher, and this greater pathogen frequency was associated with lower seedling survival. Our findings show how tree density influences populations of soil pathogens, which creates plant-soil feedbacks that contribute to community-level and population-level compensatory trends in seedling survival.},

  abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are an important tool for studying the patterns of species across environmental and geographic space. For community data, a common approach involves fitting an SDM to each species separately, although the large number of models makes interpretation difficult and fails to exploit any similarities between individual species responses. A recently proposed alternative that can potentially overcome these difficulties is species archetype models (SAMs), a model-based approach that clusters species based on their environmental response. In this paper, we compare the predictive performance of SAMs against separate SDMs using a number of multi-species data sets. Results show that SAMs improve model accuracy and discriminatory capacity compared to separate SDMs. This is achieved by borrowing strength from common species having higher information content. Moreover, the improvement increases as the species become rarer.},

We asked whether continuous host variation in susceptibility helps maintain phenotypic variation, using experiments conducted with a baculovirus that infects gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) larvae. We found that an empirically observed tradeoff between mean transmission rate and variation in transmission, which results from host heterogeneity, promotes long-term coexistence of two pathogen types in simulations of a population model. This tradeoff introduces an alternative strategy for the pathogen: a low-transmission, low-variability type can coexist with the high-transmission type favoured by classical non-heterogeneity models. In addi- tion, this tradeoff can help explain the extensive phenotypic variation we observed in field-col- lected pathogen isolates, in traits affecting virus fitness including transmission and environmental persistence. Similar heterogeneity tradeoffs might be a general mechanism promoting phenotypic variation in any pathogen for which hosts vary continuously in susceptibility.},

  abstract = {Biological invasions by nonnative species are a by-product of economic activities, with the vast majority of nonnative species introduced by trade and transport of products and people. Although most introduced species are relatively innocuous, a few species ultimately cause irreversible economic and ecological impacts, such as the chestnut blight that functionally eradicated the American chestnut across eastern North America. Assessments of the economic costs and losses induced by nonnative forest pests are required for policy development and need to adequately account for all of the economic impacts induced by rare, highly damaging pests. To date, countrywide economic evaluations of forest-invasive species have proceeded by multiplying a unit value (price) by a physical quantity (volume of forest products damaged) to arrive at aggregate estimates of economic impacts. This approach is inadequate for policy development because (1) it ignores the dynamic impacts of biological invasions on the evolution of prices, quantities, and market behavior, and (2) it fails to account for the loss in the economic value of nonmarket ecosystem services, such as landscape aesthetics, outdoor recreation, and the knowledge that healthy forest ecosystems exist. A review of the literature leads one to anticipate that the greatest economic impacts of invasive species in forests are due to the loss of nonmarket values. We proposed that new methods for evaluating aggregate economic damages from forest-invasive species need to be developed that quantify market and nonmarket impacts at microscales that are then extended using spatially explicit models to provide aggregate estimates of impacts. Finally, policies that shift the burden of economic impacts from taxpayers and forest landowners onto parties responsible for introducing or spreading invasives, whether through the imposition of tariffs on products suspected of imposing unacceptable risks on native forest ecosystems or by requiring standards on the processing of trade products before they cross international boundaries, may be most effective at reducing their impacts.},

  abstract = {Tree mortality is an important demographic process and primary driver of forest dynamics, yet there are relatively few plot-based studies that explicitly quantify mortality and compare the relative contribution of endogenous and exogenous disturbances at regional scales. We used repeated observations on 289,390 trees in 3673 1ha plots on U.S. Forest Service lands in Oregon and Washington to compare distributions of mortality rates among natural disturbances and vegetation zones from the mid-1990s to mid-2000s, a period characterized by drought, insect outbreaks, and large wildfires. Endogenous disturbances (e.g. pathogens, insects) were pervasive but operated at relatively low levels of mortality (2.5\%/yr) that rarely exceeded 5\%/yr. Exogenous disturbances (e.g. fire, wind, landslides, avalanches) were less common and operated mostly at intermediate levels of mortality (5\textendash{}25\%/yr) indicative of partial-stand-replacement events. Stand-replacing mortality rates ($\geqslant$25\%/yr) comprised a third of all exogenous disturbance events, occurring almost exclusively in fires. Fires were rare in wet vegetation zones and most rates were 2.5\%/yr and associated with endogenous processes. Mortality rates in dry vegetation zones revealed a different set of dynamics including a more variable role of background mortality and greater proportions of mortality associated with fire and insects at partial- and stand-replacing levels. Mortality rates in early and middle stages of stand development were low compared to published rates, but rates 1\%/yr in over half of the plots in late and old-growth stages corroborate previous findings of elevated mortality during the same period and indicate the potential for pervasive structural change across all vegetation zones. Partial- and stand-replacing fire were associated with most mortality, but affected a relatively small proportion of dry vegetation zones (3.1\textendash{}7.1\% and 2.1\textendash{}5.1\%, respectively). These disturbances have likely affected regional biodiversity through the creation of early seral habitat, increased within-stand heterogeneity, and restored some aspects of historical fire regimes, but there is a need to better understand corresponding structural and compositional changes. We demonstrate the variability in the drivers, magnitude, and extent of mortality across a biophysically diverse region and highlight the need to incorporate and characterize the effects of mortality at intermediate levels to develop a more comprehensive understanding of regional forest dynamics.},

Theory suggests that the ecology and density-dependence of transmission dynamics can determine the probability of disease-caused extinction, but few empirical studies have simultaneously examined multiple factors influencing disease impact. We show, in hibernating bats infected with Geomyces destructans, that impacts of disease on solitary species were lower in smaller populations, whereas in socially gregarious species declines were equally severe in populations spanning four orders of magnitude. However, as these gregarious species declined, we observed decreases in social group size that reduced the likelihood of extinction. In addition, disease impacts in these species increased with humidity and temperature such that the coldest and driest roosts provided initial refuge from disease. These results expand our theoretical framework and provide an empirical basis for determining which host species are likely to be driven extinct while management action is still possible.},

  abstract = {Climate change is expected to favor shifts in plant distributions; some such shifts are already being observed along elevation gradients. However, the rate of such shifts may be limited by their ability to reach newly suitable areas and by competition from resident species. The degree of local adaptation and genetic variation may also play a role in the interaction between migrants and residents by affecting relative fitness. We used a simulation model to explore the interacting effects of dispersal, fecundity, disturbance, and genetic variation on range-edge dynamics between a pair of demographically similar tree species. Ideal climate for an individual is determined by genotype. The simulated landscape undergoes an 80-year period of climate change in which climate bands shift upslope; subsequently, climate is held constant for 300 years. The presence of a high-elevation competitor caused a significant lag in the range shift of the low-elevation species relative to competition- free scenarios. Increases in fecundity and dispersal distance both helped to speed up the replacement of the high-elevation species by the low-elevation species at their range boundary. While some disturbance scenarios facilitated this transition, frequent canopy disturbance inhibited colonization by removing reproductive adults and led to range contractions in both species. Differences between dispersal scenarios were more pronounced when disturbance was frequent (15 vs. 25 year return interval) and dispersal was limited. When the high-elevation species lacked genetic variation, its range was more-easily invaded by the low-elevation species, while a similar lack of variation in the low-elevation species inhibited colonization-but only when this lack of variation decreased the fitness of the affected species near the range boundary. Our model results support the importance of measuring and including dispersal/ fecundity, disturbance type and frequency, and genetic variation when assessing the potential for range shifts and species vulnerability to climate change.},

  abstract = {Animal behaviour and the ecology and evolution of parasites are inextricably linked. For this reason, animal behaviourists and disease ecologists have been interested in the intersection of their respective fields for decades. Despite this interest, most research at the behaviour-disease interface focuses either on how host behaviour affects parasites or how parasites affect behaviour, with little overlap between the two. Yet, the majority of interactions between hosts and parasites are probably reciprocal, such that host behaviour feeds back on parasites and vice versa. Explicitly considering these feedbacks is essential for understanding the complex connections between animal behaviour and parasite ecology and evolution. To illustrate this point, we discuss how host behaviour-parasite feedbacks might operate and explore the consequences of feedback for studies of animal behaviour and parasites. For example, ignoring the feedback of host social structure on parasite dynamics can limit the accuracy of predictions about parasite spread. Likewise, considering feedback in studies of parasites and animal personalities may provide unique insight about the maintenance of variation in personality types. Finally, applying the feedback concept to links between host behaviour and beneficial, rather than pathogenic, microbes may shed new light on transitions between mutualism and parasitism. More generally, accounting for host behaviour-parasite feedbacks can help identify critical gaps in our understanding of how key host behaviours and parasite traits evolve and are maintained.},

Recent focus has been on emerging zoonoses and on identifying common patterns and drivers of emerging diseases. However, no overarching framework exists to integrate knowledge on all emerging infectious disease events. Here, we propose such a conceptual framework based on changes in the interplay of pathogens, hosts and environment that lead to the formation of novel disease patterns and pathogen genetic adjustment. We categorize infectious disease emergence events into three groups: (i) pathogens showing up in a novel host, ranging from spill-over, including zoonoses, to complete species jumps; (ii) mutant pathogens displaying novel traits in the same host, including an increase in virulence, antimicrobial resistance and host immune escape; and (iii) disease complexes emerging in a new geographic area, either through range expansion or through long distance jumps. Each of these categories is characterized by a typical set of drivers of emergence, matching pathogen trait profiles, disease ecology and transmission dynamics. Our framework may assist in disentangling and structuring the rapidly growing amount of available information on infectious diseases. Moreover, it may contribute to a better understanding of how human action changes disease landscapes globally.},

  abstract = {Bats are the natural reservoirs of a number of high-impact viral zoonoses. We present a quantitative analysis to address the hypothesis that bats are unique in their propensity to host zoonotic viruses based on a comparison with rodents, another important host order. We found that bats indeed host more zoonotic viruses per species than rodents, and we identified life-history and ecological factors that promote zoonotic viral richness. More zoonotic viruses are hosted by species whose distributions overlap with a greater number of other species in the same taxonomic order (sympatry). Specifically in bats, there was evidence for increased zoonotic viral richness in species with smaller litters (one young), greater longevity and more litters per year. Furthermore, our results point to a new hypothesis to explain in part why bats host more zoonotic viruses per species: the stronger effect of sympatry in bats and more viruses shared between bat species suggests that interspecific transmission is more prevalent among bats than among rodents. Although bats host more zoonotic viruses per species, the total number of zoonotic viruses identified in bats (61) was lower than in rodents (68), a result of there being approximately twice the number of rodent species as bat species. Therefore, rodents should still be a serious concern as reservoirs of emerging viruses. These findings shed light on disease emergence and perpetuation mechanisms and may help lead to a predictive framework for identifying future emerging infectious virus reservoirs.},

  doi = {10.1111/gcb.13155},
  abstract = {Managing multiple, interacting disturbances is a key challenge to biodiversity conservation, and one that will only increase as global change drivers continue to alter disturbance regimes. Theoretical studies have highlighted the importance of a mechanistic understanding of stressor interactions for improving the prediction and management of interactive effects. However, many conservation studies are not designed or interpreted in the context of theory, and instead focus on case-specific management questions. This is a problem as it means that few studies test the relationships highlighted in theoretical models as being important for ecological management. We explore the extent of this problem among studies of interacting disturbances by reviewing recent experimental studies of the interaction between fire and grazing in terrestrial ecosystems. Interactions between fire and grazing can occur via a number of pathways; one disturbance can modify the other's likelihood, intensity or spatial distribution, or one disturbance can alter the other's impacts on individual organisms. The strength of such interactions will vary depending on disturbance attributes (e.g. size or intensity), and this variation is likely to be non-linear. We show that few experiments testing fire-grazing interactions are able to identify the mechanistic pathway driving an observed interaction, and most are unable to detect non-linear effects. We demonstrate how these limitations compromise the ability of experimental studies to effectively inform ecological management. We propose a series of adjustments to the design of disturbance interaction experiments that would enable tests of key theoretical pathways, and provide the deeper ecological understanding necessary for effective management. Such considerations are relevant to studies of a broad range of ecological interactions, and are critical to informing the management of disturbance regimes in the context of accelerating global change.},

Yet, it is rarely recognised that such 'key hosts' can arise through disparate mechanisms, potentially requiring different approaches for control. We identify three distinct, but not mutually exclusive, processes that underlie host species heterogeneity: infection prevalence, population abundance and infectiousness. We construct a theoretical framework to isolate the role of each process from ecological data and to explore the outcome of different control approaches. Applying this framework to data on 11 gastrointestinal parasites in small mammal communities across the eastern United States reveals variation not only in the magnitude of transmission asymmetries among host species but also in the processes driving heterogeneity. These differences influence the efficiency by which different control strategies reduce transmission. Identifying and tailoring interventions to a specific type of key host may therefore enable more effective management of multihost parasites.},

A crucial element in understanding disease dynamics, therefore, is the 'transmission term' describing the rate at which susceptible hosts are 'converted' into infected hosts by their contact with infectious material. Recently, the conventional form of this term has been increasingly questioned, and new terminologies and conventions have been proposed. Here, therefore, we review the derivation of transmission terms, explain the basis of confusion, and provide clarification. The root of the problem has been a failure to include explicit consideration of the area occupied by a host population, alongside both the number of infectious hosts and their density within the population. We argue that the terms 'density-dependent transmission' and 'frequency-dependent transmission' remain valid and useful (though a 'fuller' transmission term for the former is identified), but that the terms 'mass action', 'true mass action' and 'pseudo mass action' are all unhelpful and should be dropped. Also, contrary to what has often been assumed, the distinction between homogeneous and heterogeneous mixing in a host population is orthogonal to the distinction between density- and frequency-dependent transmission modes.},

Although the ecological consequences of direct versus indirect species interactions have received attention, their evolutionary implications are not well understood. I examined selection on floral traits through direct versus indirect pathways of species interactions using the plant Ipomopsis aggregata and its pollinators and nectar robber. Using path analysis and structural equation modeling, I tested competing hypotheses comparing the relative importance of direct (pollinator-mediated) versus indirect (robber-mediated) interactions to trait selection through female plant function in 2 years. The hypothesis that provided the best fit to the observed data included robbing and pollination, suggesting that both interactors are important in driving selection on some traits; however, the direction and intensity of selection through robbing versus pollination varied between years. I then increased my scope of inference by assessing traits and species interactions across more years. I found that the potential for temporal variation in the direction and intensity of selection was pronounced. Taken together, results suggest that assessing the broader context in which organisms evolve, including both direct and indirect interactions and across multiple years, can provide increased mechanistic understanding of the diversity of ways that animals shape floral and plant evolution.},

  abstract = {Global climate has changed since pre-industrial times. Atmospheric CO(2), a major greenhouse gas, has increased by nearly 30\% and temperature has risen by 0.3 to 0.6 degrees C. The intergovernmental panel on climate change predicts that with the current emission scenario, global mean temperature would rise between 0.9 and 3.5 degrees C by the year 2100. There are, however, many uncertainties that influence these predictions. Despite the significance of weather on plant diseases, comprehensive analysis of how climate change will influence plant diseases that impact primary production in agricultural systems is presently unavailable. Evaluation of the limited literature in this area suggests that the most likely impact of climate change will be felt in three areas: in losses from plant diseases, in the efficacy of disease management strategies and in the geographical distribution of plant diseases. Climate change could have positive, negative or no impact on individual plant diseases. More research is needed to obtain base-line information on different disease systems. Most plant disease models use different climatic variables and operate at a different spatial and temporal scale than do the global climate models. Improvements in methodology are necessary to realistically assess disease impacts at a global scale.},

Simulations indicated either amplification or dilution may occur, with the outcome depending precisely on mechanisms of competition, host contact rates with ticks, and acquired host resistance to ticks. Quantifying these mechanisms will be crucial to predicting how biodiversity affects Lyme disease risk. Crown Copyright ?? 2009.},

  abstract = {Prediction of species' distributions is central to diverse applications in ecology, evolution and conservation science. There is increasing electronic access to vast sets of occurrence records in museums and herbaria, yet little effective guidance on how best to use this information in the context of numerous approaches for modelling distributions. To meet this need, we compared 16 modelling methods over 226 species from 6 regions of the world, creating the most comprehensive set of model comparisons to date. We used presence-only data to fit models, and independent presence-absence data to evaluate the predictions. Along with well-established modelling methods such as generalised additive models and GARP and BIOCLIM, we explored methods that either have been developed recently or have rarely been applied to modelling species' distributions. These include machine-learning methods and community models, both of which have features that may make them particularly well suited to noisy or sparse information, as is typical of species' occurrence data. Presence-only data were effective for modelling species' distributions for many species and regions. The novel methods consistently outperformed more established methods. The results of our analysis are promising for the use of data from museums and herbaria, especially as methods suited to the noise inherent in such data improve.},

Nonnormal data such as counts or proportions often defy classical statistical procedures. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) provide a more flexible approach for analyzing nonnormal data when random effects are present. The explosion of research on GLMMs in the last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating GLMM parameters in simple cases, complex GLMMs are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult. We review the use (and misuse) of GLMMs in ecology and evolution, discuss estimation and inference and summarize 'best-practice' data analysis procedures for scientists facing this challenge. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

  issn = {0012-9658},
  abstract = {From a functional perspective, changes in abundance, and ultimately species replacement, during succession are a consequence of integrated suites of traits conferring different relative ecological advantages as the environment changes over time. Here we use structural equations to model the interspecific relationships between these integrated functional traits using 34 herbaceous species from a Mediterranean old-field succession and thus quantify the notion of a plant strategy. We measured plant traits related to plant vegetative and reproductive size, leaf functioning, reproductive phenology, seed mass, and production on 15 individuals per species monitored during one growing season. The resulting structural equation model successfully accounts for the pattern of trait covariation during the first 45 years post-abandonment using just two forcing variables: time since site abandonment and seed mass; no association between time since field abandonment and seed mass was observed over these herbaceous stages of secondary succession. All other predicted traits values are determined by these two variables and the cause-effect linkage between them. Adding pre-reproductive vegetative mass as a third forcing variable noticeably increased the predictive power of the model. Increasing the time after abandonment favors species with increasing life span and pre-reproductive biomass and decreasing specific leaf area. Allometric coefficients relating vegetative and reproductive components of plant size were in accordance with allometry theory. The model confirmed the trade-off between seed mass and seed number. Maximum plant height and seed mass were major determinants of reproductive phenology. Our results show that beyond verbal conceptualization, plant ecological strategies can be quantified and modeled.},

The second part of the paper develops some matrix models for quantifying the basic reproductive number, R(0), for a variety of potential types of emergent pathogen that cause outbreaks in wildlife. These analyses emphasize the sensitivity of R(0) to heterogeneities created by either the spatial structure of the host population, or the ability of the pathogens to utilize multiple host species. At each stage we illustrate how the approach provides insight into the initial dynamics of emergent pathogens such as canine parvovirus, Lyme disease, and West Nile virus in the United States.},

  doi = {10.1186/1471-2288-6-13},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Structural equation modelling (SEM) has been increasingly used in medical statistics for solving a system of related regression equations. However, a great obstacle for its wider use has been its difficulty in handling categorical variables within the framework of generalised linear models.

METHODS: A large data set with a known structure among two related outcomes and three independent variables was generated to investigate the use of Yule's transformation of odds ratio (OR) into Q-metric by (OR-1)/(OR+1) to approximate Pearson's correlation coefficients between binary variables whose covariance structure can be further analysed by SEM. Percent of correctly classified events and non-events was compared with the classification obtained by logistic regression. The performance of SEM based on Q-metric was also checked on a small (N = 100) random sample of the data generated and on a real data set.

RESULTS: SEM successfully recovered the generated model structure. SEM of real data suggested a significant influence of a latent confounding variable which would have not been detectable by standard logistic regression. SEM classification performance was broadly similar to that of the logistic regression.

CONCLUSION: The analysis of binary data can be greatly enhanced by Yule's transformation of odds ratios into estimated correlation matrix that can be further analysed by SEM. The interpretation of results is aided by expressing them as odds ratios which are the most frequently used measure of effect in medical statistics.},

Surprisingly, the crucial step of selecting the most relevant variables has received little attention, despite its direct implications for model transferability and uncertainty. Here, we aim to address this with a continent-wide, evaluation of which climate predictors provided the most accurate SDMs for bird distributions. Location Conterminous United States. Methods For 243 species, we used yearly data since 1971 (from the North American Breeding Bird Survey) to run SDMs (six different algorithms) with combinations of six relatively uncorrelated climate predictors (selected from 22 widely used climate variables). We then estimated the importance of each predictor \textendash{} both spatially and over a 40-year time period \textendash{} by comparing the accuracy of the model obtained with or without a given predictor. Results Three temperature-related variables (annual potential evapotranspiration, mean annual temperature and growing degree days) produced significantly more accurate SDMs than any other predictors. Among precipitation predictors, annual precipitation provided the most accurate results. Albeit only rarely used in SDMs, the moisture index performed similarly strongly. Interestingly, predictors that summarize average annual climate produced more accurate distributions than seasonal predictors, despite distinct seasonal movements in most species considered. Encouragingly, spatial and temporal (over 40 years) evaluation of variables yielded very similar results. Main conclusions The approach presented here allowed us to identify the statistically most relevant predictors for birds in the USA and can be applied to other taxa and/or in different parts of the world. Appropriately selecting the most relevant predictors of species distributions at large spatial scale is vital to identifying ecologically meaningful relationships that provide the most accurate predictions under climate change or biological invasions.},

While the effect of any one disturbance may be relatively well understood, multiple interacting disturbances can cause unexpected disturbance behavior (e.g., larger extents), altered return likelihoods, or reduced ecosystem resilience and regime shifts. Given the long-lasting implications of such events, and the potential for changes in disturbance rates driven by climate change and increasing anthropogenic pressures, developing a broad conceptual understanding and some predictive ability regarding the likelihood of interactions between disturbances is crucial. Through a broad synthesis of the literature, and across multiple biomes, disturbance interactions are placed into a unified framework around the concept of changing ecosystem resistance (``linked interactions,'' alterations to likelihood, extent, or severity) or ecosystem resilience (...},

  abstract = {I provide a brief introduction to the concept of spatial autocorrelation and its incorporation into regression-type models. Spatial autocorrelation occurs when the response variable is correlated with itself at other locations in the region of interest. The autocorrelation usually takes a specific form where observations close in space are more correlated than those farther apart, and the rate of decay of the correlation is a function of the distance separating 2 locations. I present 2 commonly used models: 1) geostatistical modeling in which data are collected at points in the study region and 2) conditional autoregression (lattice) models in which data are aggregated over small nonoverlapping sub-areas of the study region. I also describe incorporation of explanatory covariates, such as habitat or physico-chemical attributes. I emphasize frequentist methods, but I briefly describe Bayesian approaches. I also provide some advantages, such as obtaining correct standard errors for estimators, and disadvantages, such as requirements for larger sample sizes, of incorporating spatial autocorrelation into the modeling effort. This information can aid researchers in designing and analyzing models of the relationships between species distributions and habitat. As a result, more informative models can be developed which further aid in management of wildlife.},

Increasingly, users request that FIA data and information be reported and distributed in a geospatial context, and they request access to exact plot locations for their own analyses. However, the FIA program is constrained by law from disclosing exact locations and, instead, releases only approximate locations. The results of the study indicate that the effects of using approximate locations are negligible for design-based estimates for circular areas of radii greater than approximately 20 mi (32 km). For model-based estimates, the results are less definitive and depend on the modeling technique, the spatial resolution of units on which variables are observed, spatial correlation in the variables, and the quality of fit of the model to the data. Several methods for circumventing the effects of the approximate locations are discussed.},

  doi = {10.1038/nature12914},
  abstract = {Forests are major components of the global carbon cycle, providing substantial feedback to atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Our ability to understand and predict changes in the forest carbon cycle--particularly net primary productivity and carbon storage--increasingly relies on models that represent biological processes across several scales of biological organization, from tree leaves to forest stands. Yet, despite advances in our understanding of productivity at the scales of leaves and stands, no consensus exists about the nature of productivity at the scale of the individual tree, in part because we lack a broad empirical assessment of whether rates of absolute tree mass growth (and thus carbon accumulation) decrease, remain constant, or increase as trees increase in size and age. Here we present a global analysis of 403 tropical and temperate tree species, showing that for most species mass growth rate increases continuously with tree size. Thus, large, old trees do not act simply as senescent carbon reservoirs but actively fix large amounts of carbon compared to smaller trees; at the extreme, a single big tree can add the same amount of carbon to the forest within a year as is contained in an entire mid-sized tree. The apparent paradoxes of individual tree growth increasing with tree size despite declining leaf-level and stand-level productivity can be explained, respectively, by increases in a tree's total leaf area that outpace declines in productivity per unit of leaf area and, among other factors, age-related reductions in population density. Our results resolve conflicting assumptions about the nature of tree growth, inform efforts to undertand and model forest carbon dynamics, and have additional implications for theories of resource allocation and plant senescence.},

  abstract = {Predicting habitat suitability under climate change is vital to conserving biodiversity. However, current species distribution models rely on coarse scale climate data, whereas fine scale microclimate data may be necessary to assess habitat suitability and generate predictive models. Here, we evaluate disparities between temperature data at the coarse scale from weather stations versus fine-scale data measured in microhabitats required for a climate-sensitive mammal, the American pika (Ochotona princeps). We collected two years of temperature data in occupied talus habitats predicted to be suitable (high elevation) and unsuitable (low elevation) by the bioclimatic envelope approach. At low elevations, talus surface and interstitial microclimates drastically differed from ambient temperatures measured on-site and at a nearby weather station. Interstitial talus temperatures were frequently decoupled from high ambient temperatures, resulting in instantaneous disparities of over 30$^\circ$C between these two measurements. Microhabitat temperatures were also highly heterogeneous, such that temperature measurements within the same patch of talus were not more correlated than measurements at distant patches. An experimental manipulation revealed that vegetation cover may cool the talus surface by up to 10$^\circ$C during the summer, which may contribute to this spatial heterogeneity. Finally, low elevation microclimates were milder and less variable than typical alpine habitat, suggesting that, counter to species distribution model predictions, these seemingly unsuitable habitats may actually be better refugia for this species under climate change. These results highlight the importance of fine-scale microhabitat data in habitat assessments and underscore the notion that some critical refugia may be counterintuitive.},

Contrary to their claims, the dilution effect is not a 'mantra' that asserts that reduced disease risk is a 'universal' outcome of high diversity.

  abstract = {The twin concepts of zooprophylaxis and the dilution effect originated with vector-borne diseases (malaria), were driven forward by studies on Lyme borreliosis and have now developed into the mantra "biodiversity protects against disease". The basic idea is that by diluting the assemblage of transmission-competent hosts with non-competent hosts, the probability of vectors feeding on transmission-competent hosts is reduced and so the abundance of infected vectors is lowered. The same principle has recently been applied to other infectious disease systems--tick-borne, insect-borne, indirectly transmitted via intermediate hosts, directly transmitted. It is claimed that the presence of extra species of various sorts, acting through a variety of distinct mechanisms, causes the prevalence of infectious agents to decrease. Examination of the theoretical and empirical evidence for this hypothesis reveals that it applies only in certain circumstances even amongst tick-borne diseases, and even less often if considering the correct metric--abundance rather than prevalence of infected vectors. Whether dilution or amplification occurs depends more on specific community composition than on biodiversity per se. We warn against raising a straw man, an untenable argument easily dismantled and dismissed. The intrinsic value of protecting biodiversity and ecosystem function outweighs this questionable utilitarian justification.},

  abstract = {Growing interest in ecology has recently focused on the hypothesis that community diversity can mediate infection levels and disease ('dilution effect'). In turn, biodiversity loss--a widespread consequence of environmental change--can indirectly promote increases in disease, including those of medical and veterinary importance. While this work has focused primarily on correlational studies involving vector-borne microparasite diseases (e.g. Lyme disease, West Nile virus), we argue that parasites with complex life cycles (e.g. helminths, protists, myxosporeans and many fungi) offer an excellent additional model in which to experimentally address mechanistic questions underlying the dilution effect. Here, we unite recent ecological research on the dilution effect in microparasites with decades of parasitological research on the decoy effect in macroparasites to explore key questions surrounding the relationship between community structure and disease. We find consistent evidence that community diversity significantly alters parasite transmission and pathology under laboratory as well as natural conditions. Empirical examples and simple transmission models highlight the diversity of mechanisms through which such changes occur, typically involving predators, parasite decoys, low competency hosts or other parasites. However, the degree of transmission reduction varies among diluting species, parasite stage, and across spatial scales, challenging efforts to make quantitative, taxon-specific predictions about disease. Taken together, this synthesis highlights the broad link between community structure and disease while underscoring the importance of mitigating ongoing changes in biological communities owing to species introductions and extirpations.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that increasing biodiversity, specifically host diversity, reduces pathogen and parasite transmission amongst wildlife (causing a "dilution effect"), whereby transmission amongst efficient reservoir hosts, (e.g. Peromyscus spp. mice for the agent of Lyme disease Borrelia burgdorferi) is reduced by the presence of other less efficient host species. If so, then increasing biodiversity should inhibit pathogen and parasite invasion.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We investigated this hypothesis by studying invasion of B. burgdorferi and its tick vector Ixodes scapularis in 71 field sites in southeastern Canada. Indices of trapped rodent host diversity, and of biodiversity of the wider community, were investigated as variables explaining the numbers of I. scapularis collected and B. burgdorferi infection in these ticks. A wide range of alternative environmental explanatory variables were also considered.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The observation of low I. scapularis abundance and low B. burgdorferi infection prevalence in sites where I. scapularis were detected was consistent with early-stage invasion of the vector. There were significant associations between the abundance of ticks and season, year of study and ambient temperature. Abundance of host-seeking larvae was significantly associated with deer density, and abundance of host-seeking larvae and nymphs were positively associated with litter layer depth. Larval host infestations were lower where the relative proportion of non-Peromyscus spp. was high. Infestations of hosts with nymphs were lower when host species richness was higher, but overall nymphal abundance increased with species richness because Peromyscus spp. mouse abundance and host species richness were positively correlated. Nymphal infestations of hosts were lower where tree species richness was higher. B. burgdorferi infection prevalence in ticks varied significantly with an index of rates of migratory bird-borne vector and pathogen invasion.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: I. scapularis abundance and B. burgdorferi prevalence varied with explanatory variables in patterns consistent with the known biology of these species in general, and in the study region in particular. The evidence for a negative effect of host biodiversity on I. scapularis invasion was mixed. However, some evidence suggests that community biodiversity beyond just host diversity may have direct or indirect inhibitory effects on parasite invasion that warrant further study.},

  abstract = {Patches of live, dead, and dying trees resulting from bark beetle-caused mortality alter spatial and temporal variability in the canopy and surface fuel complex through changes in the foliar moisture content of attacked trees and through the redistribution of canopy fuels. The resulting heterogeneous fuels complexes alter within-canopy wind flow, wind fluctuations, and rate of fire spread. However, there is currently little information about the potential influence of different rates and patterns of mortality on wind flow and fire behavior following bark beetle outbreaks. In this study, we contrasted within-canopy wind flow and fire rate-of-spread (ROS) at two different ambient wind speeds using FIRETEC for two differing bark beetle attack trajectories for a lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forest. These two attack trajectories represent different realizations of a bark beetle outbreak and result in different amounts and patterns of mortality through time. Our simulations suggested that the mean within-canopy wind velocities increased through time following the progression of mortality. In addition, we found that for a given level of mortality, a bark beetle outbreak that resulted in a higher degree of aggregation of canopy fuels had greater mean within-canopy wind velocities due to the channeling of wind flow. These findings suggest that bark beetle mortality can influence the mean within-canopy wind flow in two ways: first, by reducing the amount of vegetation present in the canopy acting as a source of drag; and second, by altering spatial patterns of vegetation that can lead to channeling of wind flow. Changes in the fire rate-of-spread were positively related to the level and continuity of bark beetle mortality. Peak rates of spread were between 1.2 and 2.7 times greater than the pre-outbreak scenario and coincided with a high level of mortality and minimal loss of canopy fuels. Following the loss of canopy fuels the rate of fire spread declined to levels below the initial phases of the outbreak in low wind speed cases but remained above pre-outbreak levels in high wind speed cases. These findings suggest that the rate and pattern of mortality arising from a bark beetle outbreak exerts significant influence on the magnitude and timing of alterations to the within-canopy wind flow and rate of fire spread. Our findings help clarify existing knowledge gaps related to the effect of bark beetle outbreaks on fire behavior and could explain potential differences in the reported effects of bark beetle outbreaks on fire behavior through time.},

To isolate matrix effects from the often simultaneous and confounding influence of patch and landscape characteristics, we identified nineteen 500 mradius landscapes in southeastQueensland, Australiawith similar remnant forest patch attributes, habitat loss, and fragmentation, but exhibiting a marked gradient from rural through high-density suburban development of the matrix, quantified by a weighted road-length metric. We measured habitat disturbance, structure, and floristics in patch core, patch edge andmatrix landscape elements to characterise how landscape habitat quality changes for small mammals. Correlation analyses identified that with increased matrix development intensity, human disturbance of core sites increased, predators and exotic plant species richness in matrix sites increased, and structural complexity (e.g. logs and stumps) in the matrix decreased. Ordination analyses showed landscape elements were most similar in habitat structure and floristics at low to moderate levels of matrix development, suggesting enhanced landscape habitat quality. Matrix development intensity was not, however, the greatest source of overall variation of habitat throughout landscapes. Many variables, such as landholder behaviour, complicate the relationship. For enhanced conservation outcomes the matrix needs to be managed to control disturbances and strategically plan for matrix habitat retention and restoration.},

  doi = {10.1038/nature04153},
  abstract = {Population-level analyses often use average quantities to describe heterogeneous systems, particularly when variation does not arise from identifiable groups. A prominent example, central to our current understanding of epidemic spread, is the basic reproductive number, R(0), which is defined as the mean number of infections caused by an infected individual in a susceptible population. Population estimates of R(0) can obscure considerable individual variation in infectiousness, as highlighted during the global emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) by numerous 'superspreading events' in which certain individuals infected unusually large numbers of secondary cases. For diseases transmitted by non-sexual direct contacts, such as SARS or smallpox, individual variation is difficult to measure empirically, and thus its importance for outbreak dynamics has been unclear. Here we present an integrated theoretical and statistical analysis of the influence of individual variation in infectiousness on disease emergence. Using contact tracing data from eight directly transmitted diseases, we show that the distribution of individual infectiousness around R(0) is often highly skewed. Model predictions accounting for this variation differ sharply from average-based approaches, with disease extinction more likely and outbreaks rarer but more explosive. Using these models, we explore implications for outbreak control, showing that individual-specific control measures outperform population-wide measures. Moreover, the dramatic improvements achieved through targeted control policies emphasize the need to identify predictive correlates of higher infectiousness. Our findings indicate that superspreading is a normal feature of disease spread, and to frame ongoing discussion we propose a rigorous definition for superspreading events and a method to predict their frequency.},

Pathogen spillover is widely documented in$\backslash$ncrop systems, but has been little studied in natural plant communities.$\backslash$n2. The abundant seed production of weedy species may create a scenario$\backslash$nwhere spillover of a generalist seed pathogen onto less abundant seeds$\backslash$nof native hosts is possible. The invasive annual weed cheatgrass (Bromus$\backslash$ntectorum) is a potential reservoir species for Pyrenophora semeniperda,$\backslash$na multiple-host fungal seed pathogen that naturally occurs in the$\backslash$nsemi-arid western United States.$\backslash$n3. To investigate potential community-level consequences of spillover by$\backslash$nthis pathogen in plant communities invaded by cheatgrass, we first used$\backslash$nartificial inoculation studies to determine the relative susceptibility$\backslash$nof seeds of cheatgrass and five co-occurring native grasses to P.$\backslash$nsemeniperda. Secondly, we quantified the pathogen reservoir (density of$\backslash$npathogen-killed seeds) in the spring seed bank for cheatgrass$\backslash$nmonoculture, cheatgrass-invaded native grass, and uninvaded native grass$\backslash$npatches. Thirdly, potential pathogen spillover onto co-occurring native$\backslash$ngrasses was quantified by planting native grass seeds into$\backslash$nfield-collected seed-zone samples from each vegetation patch type and$\backslash$nscoring subsequent seed mortality.$\backslash$n4. All species tested were susceptible to infection by P. semeniperda,$\backslash$nbut their vulnerability to seed death varied as a function of$\backslash$ngermination time and degree of susceptibility.$\backslash$n5. Seed bank samples from cheatgrass-dominated patches contained seed$\backslash$ndensities over four times higher than samples from uninvaded native$\backslash$ngrass patches, and P. semeniperda-killed seeds were also present at much$\backslash$nhigher densities, indicating that cheatgrass can function as a reservoir$\backslash$nfor P. semeniperda. Native seeds planted into seed-zone samples from$\backslash$ncheatgrass-dominated patches were more likely to be killed by P.$\backslash$nsemeniperda than those planted into samples from uninvaded native$\backslash$npatches.

Although the potential for pathogen spillover is widespread, its consequences for host community composition remain poorly understood. To address this gap, I examine the consequences of fungal seed pathogen spillover from an exotic annual grass (cheatgrass) to a native perennial bunchgrass in the Intermountain West, United States, using a model. Integrating generalist pathogens with broader coexistence theory, the model measures the pathogen's effect on host niche differences and fitness differences, which determine the outcome of competition. The model demonstrates that the consequences of pathogen spillover depend on host differences in species-specific transmission and disease tolerance. Counterintuitively, spillover can lead to coexistence, native grass exclusion, or priority effects, in which either species can exclude the other when initially more dominant. Cheatgrass has higher tolerance for infection, which could lead to competitive dominance or to coexistence if the native grass has a fecundity or survival advantage. In sum, multihost pathogens can affect host communities in a range of ways, depending on the specific mechanism of spillover.},

  abstract = {Many emerging pathogens infect both domesticated and wild host species, creating the potential for pathogen transmission between domesticated and wild populations. This common situation raises the question of whether managing negative impacts of disease on a focal host population (whether domesticated, endangered, or pest) requires management of only the domesticated host, only the wild host, or both. To evaluate the roles of domesticated and wild hosts in the dynamics of shared pathogens, we developed a spatially implicit model of a pathogen transmitted by airborne spores between two host species restricted to two different landscape patch types. As well as exploring the general dynamics and implications of the model, we fully parameterized our model for Asian soybean rust, a multihost infectious disease that emerged in the United States in 2004. The rust fungus Phakopsora pachyrhizi infects many legume species, including soybeans (Glycine max) and the nonnative invasive species kudzu (Pueraria montana var. lobata). Our model predicts that epidemics are driven by the host species that is more abundant in the landscape. In managed landscapes, this will generally be the domesticated host. However, many pathogens overwinter on a wild host, which acts as the source of initial inoculum at the start of the growing season. Our model predicts that very low local densities of infected wild hosts, surviving in landscape patches separate from the domesticated host, are sufficient to initiate epidemics in the domesticated host, such that managing epidemics by reducing wild host local density may not be feasible. In contrast, managing to reduce pathogen infection of a domesticated host can reduce disease impacts on wild host populations.},

  abstract = {This review synthesizes the available knowledge on drought-disease interactions in forest trees with a focus on (1) evidence and patterns of drought-disease interactions, (2) current understanding of processes and mechanisms, and (3) three well documented cases studies. The first part is based on the analysis of a database of slightly more than one hundred studies, obtained by keyword searches combining drought, diseases or pathogens, and forest trees. Alargemajority of published studies referred to a positive association between drought and disease, i.e. disease favoured by drought or drought and disease acting synergistically on tree health status, with a predominance of canker/dieback diseases, caused by pathogens like Botryosphaeria, Sphaeropsis, Cytospora and Biscognauxia (Hypoxylon). The type of disease-related variables (incidence vs. severity) and the intensity and timing of water stress were shown to be significant factors affecting the drought- infection interaction. Interactions with other abiotic stresses and species-specific and genetic effects, related to host or pathogen, have also been reported. Direct effects of drought on pathogens are generally negative, although most fungal pathogens exhibit an important plasticity and can grow at water potentials well below the minimum for growth of their host plants. Studies on indirect effects of drought on pathogens through other community interactions are still relatively scarce. Positive drought-infection effects can mostly be explained by indirect effects of drought on host physiology. The predisposition and the multiple stress hypotheses are presented, as well as recent developments in the study of the molecular basis of abiotic and biotic stress, and their interactions. Sphaeropsis sapinea on pines, Biscognauxia mediterranea on oaks and root pathogens in declines associated with drought provide illustrative examples, treated as case studies, of pathogens of current significance associated with drought. The conclusion highlights some knowledge gaps, e.g. the role of latent parasites and the shift to a pathogenic stage, or the genetics of some fungal groups. The need for prevention of pathogen dispersal, especially crucial in the case of latent pathogens, is emphasized.},

Many of these methods are quite new and most are generally unknown to biologists. In addition to describing how to conduct these statistical tests, the book also puts the methods into historical context and explains when they can and cannot justifiably be used to test or discover causal claims.

  abstract = {Many serious emerging zoonotic infections have recently arisen from bats, including Ebola, Marburg, SARS-coronavirus, Hendra, Nipah, and a number of rabies and rabies-related viruses, consistent with the overall observation that wildlife are an important source of emerging zoonoses for the human population. Mechanisms underlying the recognized association between ecosystem health and human health remain poorly understood and responding appropriately to the ecological, social and economic conditions that facilitate disease emergence and transmission represents a substantial societal challenge. In the context of disease emergence from wildlife, wildlife and habitat should be conserved, which in turn will preserve vital ecosystem structure and function, which has broader implications for human wellbeing and environmental sustainability, while simultaneously minimizing the spillover of pathogens from wild animals into human beings. In this review, we propose a novel framework for the holistic and interdisciplinary investigation of zoonotic disease emergence and its drivers, using the spillover of bat pathogens as a case study. This study has been developed to gain a detailed interdisciplinary understanding, and it combines cutting-edge perspectives from both natural and social sciences, linked to policy impacts on public health, land use and conservation.},

  abstract = {Aim Our aims were to: (1) reconstruct the fire history of pine-oak forests in the central Appalachian Mountains, USA, with an annual resolution over as long a time period as possible using dendroecological techniques; (2) estimate the frequency of fire in the study area before the fire-suppression era; and (3) investigate how variations in land use and climate have affected the occurrence of fire in the study area. Location Temperate forests at three study sites within the central Appalachian Mountains, Virginia, USA. Methods Cross-sections were taken (sawn) from fire-scarred pine ( Pinus L.) trees growing in pine-dominated patches within a hardwood forest matrix. Dendroecological techniques were used to date the scars, which were used to calculate fire intervals. A variety of analyses were carried out: Pearson correlation analysis, to investigate whether fire activity varied over time (under changing land uses); Kruskal- Wallis analysis, to examine whether fire frequency varied spatially (among study sites); chi-square analysis, to test whether scar seasonality changed temporally; and superposed epoch analysis, to explore whether fire activity was associated with interannual climatic variations in moisture, as characterized by the Palmer drought severity index ( PDSI). Results Fire scars dated back to the 17th or early 18th century (depending on site). The filtered composite fire interval, considered to be a particularly reliable estimate of fire interval, averaged between 6 and 8 years. Fire frequency remained fairly constant from the beginning of the record until effective fire suppression began in the early 20th century, after which burning virtually ceased. Fire occurred more frequently at the easternmost site, which was located in the Blue Ridge province of the Appalachian Mountains, than at the other two sites, in the Ridge and Valley province. Scar seasonality showed no discernible trend over time. Fire was associated with low PDSI (i.e. dry years) at two of the study sites. Main conclusions Fire occurred frequently at these central Appalachian study sites during the period of aboriginal depopulation that preceded European colonization, and throughout the periods of European settlement and industrialization (with mining, logging and railroads) that followed. Our results match those from other fire-history sites in the central and southern Appalachian Mountains, and suggest that fire was an important factor influencing vegetation development in the temperate forests covering this region.

  abstract = {Post-fire predictions of forest recovery under future climate change and management actions are necessary for forest managers to make decisions about treatments. We applied the Climate-Forest Vegetation Simulator (Climate-FVS), a new version of a widely used forest management model, to compare alternative climate and management scenarios in a severely burned multispecies forest of Arizona, USA. The incorporation of seven combinations of General Circulation Models (GCM) and emissions scenarios altered long-term (100 years) predictions of future forest condition compared to a No Climate Change (NCC) scenario, which forecast a gradual increase to high levels of forest density and carbon stock. In contrast, emissions scenarios that included continued high greenhouse gas releases led to near-complete deforestation by 2111. GCM-emissions scenario combinations that were less severe reduced forest structure and carbon stock relative to NCC. Fuel reduction treatments that had been applied prior to the severe wildfire did have persistent effects, especially under NCC, but were overwhelmed by increasingly severe climate change. We tested six management strategies aimed at sustaining future forests: prescribed burning at 5, 10, or 20-year intervals, thinning 40\% or 60\% of stand basal area, and no treatment. Severe climate change led to deforestation under all management regimes, but important differences emerged under the moderate scenarios: treatments that included regular prescribed burning fostered low density, wildfire-resistant forests composed of the naturally dominant species, ponderosa pine. Non-fire treatments under moderate climate change were forecast to become dense and susceptible to severe wildfire, with a shift to dominance by sprouting species. Current U.S. forest management requires modeling of future scenarios but does not mandate consideration of climate change effects. However, this study showed substantial differences in model outputs depending on climate and management actions. Managers should incorporate climate change into the process of analyzing the environmental effects of alternative actions.},

Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.},

Weight gain measurement during anti tuberculosis (TB) treatment period is an important component to assess the progress of TB patients. In this study, Latent Growth Models (LGMs) were implemented in a longitudinal design to predict the change in weight of TB patients who were given three different regimens under randomized controlled clinical trial for anti-TB treatment. Linear and Quadratic LGMs were fitted using Mplus software. The age, sex and treatment response of the TB patients were used as time invariant independent variables of the growth trajectories. The quadratic trend was found to be better in explaining the changes in weight without grouping than the quadratic model for three group comparisons. A significant increase in the change of weight over time was identified while a significant quadratic effect indicated that weights were sustained over time. The growth rate was similar in both the groups. The treatment response had significant association with the growth rate of weight scores of the patients.},

We discuss some contemporary forms of structural equation models (SEMs) based on the inclusion of latent variables. The specific goals of this review are to clarify basic SEM definitions, consider relations to classical models, focus on testable features of the new models, and provide recent references to more complete presentations. A broader goal is to illustrate why so many researchers are enthusiastic about the SEM approach to data analysis. We first outline some classic problems in longitudinal data analysis, consider definitions of differences and changes, and raise issues about measurement errors. We then present several classic SEMs based on the inclusion of invariant common factors and explain why these are so important. This leads to newer SEMs based on latent change scores, and we explain why these are useful.},

  abstract = {Climate change may facilitate alien species invasion into new areas, particularly for species from warm native ranges introduced into areas currently marginal for temperature. Although conclusions from modelling approaches and experimental studies are generally similar, combining the two approaches has rarely occurred. The aim of this study was to validate species distribution models by conducting field trials in sites of differing suitability as predicted by the models, thus increasing confidence in their ability to assess invasion risk. Three recently naturalized alien plants in New Zealand were used as study species (Archontophoenix cunninghamiana, Psidium guajava and Schefflera actinophylla): they originate from warm native ranges, are woody bird-dispersed species and of concern as potential weeds. Seedlings were grown in six sites across the country, differing both in climate and suitability (as predicted by the species distribution models). Seedling growth and survival were recorded over two summers and one or two winter seasons, and temperature and precipitation were monitored hourly at each site. Additionally, alien seedling performances were compared to those of closely related native species (Rhopalostylis sapida, Lophomyrtus bullata and Schefflera digitata). Furthermore, half of the seedlings were sprayed with pesticide, to investigate whether enemy release may influence performance. The results showed large differences in growth and survival of the alien species among the six sites. In the more suitable sites, performance was frequently higher compared to the native species. Leaf damage from invertebrate herbivory was low for both alien and native seedlings, with little evidence that the alien species should have an advantage over the native species because of enemy release. Correlations between performance in the field and predicted suitability of species distribution models were generally high. The projected increase in minimum temperature and reduced frosts with climate change may provide more suitable habitats and enable the spread of these species.},

  issn = {1573-2959},
  doi = {10.1007/s10661-014-3912-5},
  abstract = {Large areas of public lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management and located in arid regions of the southwestern United States are being considered for the development of utility-scale solar energy facilities. Land-disturbing activities in these desert, alluvium-filled valleys have the potential to adversely affect the hydrologic and ecologic functions of ephemeral streams. Regulation and management of ephemeral streams typically falls under a spectrum of federal, state, and local programs, but scientifically based guidelines for protecting ephemeral streams with respect to land-development activities are largely nonexistent. This study developed an assessment approach for quantifying the sensitivity to land disturbance of ephemeral stream reaches located in proposed solar energy zones (SEZs). The ephemeral stream assessment approach used publicly-available geospatial data on hydrology, topography, surficial geology, and soil characteristics, as well as high-resolution aerial imagery. These datasets were used to inform a professional judgment-based score index of potential land disturbance impacts on selected critical functions of ephemeral streams, including flow and sediment conveyance, ecological habitat value, and groundwater recharge. The total sensitivity scores (sum of scores for the critical stream functions of flow and sediment conveyance, ecological habitats, and groundwater recharge) were used to identify highly sensitive stream reaches to inform decisions on developable areas in SEZs. Total sensitivity scores typically reflected the scores of the individual stream functions; some exceptions pertain to groundwater recharge and ecological habitats. The primary limitations of this assessment approach were the lack of high-resolution identification of ephemeral stream channels in the existing National Hydrography Dataset, and the lack of mechanistic processes describing potential impacts on ephemeral stream functions at the watershed scale. The primary strength of this assessment approach is that it allows watershed-scale planning for low-impact development in arid ecosystems; the qualitative scoring of potential impacts can also be adjusted to accommodate new geospatial data, and to allow for expert and stakeholder input into decisions regarding the identification and potential avoidance of highly sensitive stream reaches.},

  abstract = {As a result of ongoing changes in climate, hydrologic and ecologic effects are being seen across the western United States. A regional study of how climate change affects water resources and habitats in the San Francisco Bay area relied on historical climate data and future projections of climate, which were downscaled to fine spatial scales for application to a regional water-balance model. Changes in climate, potential evapotranspiration, recharge, runoff, and climatic water deficit were modeled for the Bay Area. In addition, detailed studies in the Russian River Valley and Santa Cruz Mountains, which are on the northern and southern extremes of the Bay Area, respectively, were carried out in collaboration with local water agencies. Resource managers depend on science- based projections to inform planning exercises that result in competent adaptation to ongoing and future changes in water supply and environmental conditions. Results indicated large spatial variability in climate change and the hydrologic response across the region; although there is warming under all projections, potential change in precipitation by the end of the 21st century differed according to model. Hydrologic models predicted reduced early and late wet season runoff for the end of the century for both wetter and drier future climate projections, which could result in an extended dry season. In fact, summers are projected to be longer and drier in the future than in the past regardless of precipitation trends. While water supply could be subject to increased variability (that is, reduced reliability) due to greater variability in precipitation, water demand is likely to steadily increase because of increased evapotranspiration rates and climatic water deficit during the extended summers. Extended dry season conditions and the potential for drought, combined with unprecedented increases in precipitation, could serve as additional stressors on water quality and habitat. By focusing on the relationship between soil moisture storage and evapotranspiration pressures, climatic water deficit integrates the effects of increasing temperature and varying precipitation on basin conditions. At the fine-scale used for these analyses, this variable is an effective indicator of the areas in the landscape that are the most resilient or vulnerable to projected changes. These analyses have shown that regardless of the direction of precipitation change, climatic water deficit is projected to increase, which implies greater water demand to maintain current agricultural resources or land cover. Fine-scale modeling provides a spatially distributed view of locations in the landscape that could prove to be resilient to climatic changes in contrast to locations where vegetation is currently living on the edge of its present-day bioclimatic distribution and, therefore, is more likely to perish or shift to other dominant species under future warming. This type of modeling and the associated analyses provide a useful means for greater understanding of water and land resources, which can lead to better resource management and planning.},

  issn = {0012-9658},
  abstract = {Severe drought episodes such as those associated with El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events influence large areas of tropical forest and may become more frequent in the future. One of the most important forest responses to severe drought is tree mortality, which alters forest structure, composition, carbon content, and flammability, and which varies widely. This study tests the hypothesis that tree mortality increases abruptly during drought episodes when plant-available soil water (PAW) declines below a critical minimum threshold. It also examines the effect of tree size, plant life form (palm, liana, tree) and potential canopy position (understory, midcanopy, overstory) on drought-induced plant mortality. A severe, four-year drought episode was simulated by excluding 60\% of incoming throughfall during each wet season using plastic panels installed in the understory of a 1-ha forest treatment plot, while a 1-ha control plot received normal rainfall. After 3.2 years, the treatment resulted in a 38\% increase in mortality rates across all stems 2 cm dbh. Mortality rates increased 4.5-fold among large trees (30 cm dbh) and twofold among medium trees (10-30 cm dbh) in response to the treatment, whereas the smallest stems were less responsive. Recruitment rates did not compensate for the elevated mortality of larger-diameter stems in the treatment plot. Overall, lianas proved more susceptible to drought-induced mortality than trees or palms, and potential overstory tree species were more vulnerable than midcanopy and understory species. Large stems contributed to 90\% of the pretreatment live aboveground biomass in both plots. Large-tree mortality resulting from the treatment generated 3.4 times more dead biomass than the control plot. The dramatic mortality response suggests significant, adverse impacts on the global carbon cycle if climatic changes follow current trends.},

  abstract = {Severe droughts have been associated with regional-scale forest mortality worldwide. Climate change is expected to exacerbate regional mortality events; however, prediction remains difficult because the physiological mechanisms underlying drought survival and mortality are poorly understood. We developed a hydraulically based theory considering carbon balance and insect resistance that allowed development and examination of hypotheses regarding survival and mortality. Multiple mechanisms may cause mortality during drought. A common mechanism for plants with isohydric regulation of water status results from avoidance of drought-induced hydraulic failure via stomatal closure, resulting in carbon starvation and a cascade of downstream effects such as reduced resistance to biotic agents. Mortality by hydraulic failure per se may occur for isohydric seedlings or trees near their maximum height. Although anisohydric plants are relatively drought-tolerant, they are predisposed to hydraulic failure because they operate with narrower hydraulic safety margins during drought. Elevated temperatures should exacerbate carbon starvation and hydraulic failure. Biotic agents may amplify and be amplified by drought-induced plant stress. Wet multidecadal climate oscillations may increase plant susceptibility to drought-induced mortality by stimulating shifts in hydraulic architecture, effectively predisposing plants to water stress. Climate warming and increased frequency of extreme events will probably cause increased regional mortality episodes. Isohydric and anisohydric water potential regulation may partition species between survival and mortality, and, as such, incorporating this hydraulic framework may be effective for modeling plant survival and mortality under future climate conditions.},

  doi = {10.1890/13-2317.1},
  abstract = {Fungal plant pathogens are common in natural communities where they affect plant physiology, plant survival, and biomass production. Conversely, pathogen transmission and infection may be regulated by plant community characteristics such as plant species diversity and functional composition that favor pathogen diversity through increases in host diversity while simultaneously reducing pathogen infection via increased variability in host density and spatial heterogeneity. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of multi-host\textendash{} multi-pathogen interactions is of high significance in the context of biodiversity\textendash{}ecosystem functioning. We investigated the relationship between plant diversity and aboveground obligate parasitic fungal pathogen (``pathogens'' hereafter) diversity and infection in grasslands of a long-term, large-scale, biodiversity experiment with varying plant species (1\textendash{} 60 species) and plant functional group diversity (1\textendash{}4 groups). To estimate pathogen infection of the plant communities, we visually assessed pathogen-group presence (i.e., rusts, powdery mildews, downy mildews, smuts, and leaf-spot diseases) and overall infection levels (combining incidence and severity of each pathogen group) in 82 experimental plots on all aboveground organs of all plant species per plot during four surveys in 2006. Pathogen diversity, assessed as the cumulative number of pathogen groups on all plant species per plot, increased log-linearly with plant species diversity. However, pathogen incidence and severity, and hence overall infection, decreased with increasing plant species diversity. In addition, co-infection of plant individuals by two or more pathogen groups was less likely with increasing plant community diversity. We conclude that plant community diversity promotes pathogen-community diversity while at the same time reducing pathogen infection levels of plant individuals.},

These species comprise the biodiversity of any given community. Common biodiversity metrics such as richness, evenness, and the species abundance distribution are frequently used to describe biodiversity across ecosystems and taxonomic groups. While it is increasingly clear that researchers will need to forecast changes in biodiversity, ecology currently lacks a framework for understanding the natural background variability in biodiversity or how biodiversity patterns will respond to environmental change. We predict that while species populations depend on local ecological mechanisms (e.g., niche processes) and should respond strongly to disturbance, community- level properties that emerge from these species should generally be less sensitive to disturbance because they depend on regional mechanisms (e.g., compensatory dynamics). Using published data from terrestrial animal communities, we show that community-level properties were generally resilient under a suite of artificial and natural manipulations. In contrast, species responded readily to manipulation. Our results suggest that community-level measures are poor indicators of change, perhaps because many systems display strong compensatory dynamics maintaining community-level properties. We suggest that ecologists consider using multiple metrics that measure composition and structure in biodiversity response studies.},

  abstract = {Few investigations on host diversification at the landscape scale to control plant disease in agricultural systems are available in the literature. At this scale, landscape connectivity measures how the landscape structure facilitates or impedes the disease spread among host patches. We developed a simulation model, giving a particular attention to the representation of the landscape structures, and we characterized the landscape connectivity by the proportion and the aggregation level of the host varieties, the ability for the pathogen to develop on each host and its ability to disperse. The pathogen dynamics was represented by a matrix population model designed for a generic air-borne foliar disease. This framework was used to establish a detailed assessment of the influence of each landscape connectivity variable on the pathogen population dynamics. When deploying a host with complete resistance to the pathogen along with a susceptible host, mixed landscapes were always found to be more efficient to hamper the disease spread. However, when using a quantitatively resistant host, aggregating the hosts in different regions could result in a better control of the pathogen spread, depending on the proportion and level of resistance of the resistant host and according to a source\textendash{}sink dynamics between the two hosts. The ability of the pathogen to disperse did not change the results from a qualitative point of view. By accounting explicitly for the landscape features, our approach can be used to guide further data analysis or to evaluate the effectiveness of control strategies designed at the landscape scale.},

We analysed changes in abundance of over 4000 tree species in 12 forests across the world over periods of 6-28~years. Abundance fluctuations in all forests are large and consistent with population dynamics models in which temporal environmental variance plays a central role. At some sites we identify clear environmental drivers, such as fire and drought, that could underlie these patterns, but at other sites there is a need for further research to identify drivers. In addition, cross-site comparisons showed that abundance fluctuations were smaller at species-rich sites, consistent with the idea that stable environmental conditions promote higher diversity. Much community ecology theory emphasises demographic variance and niche stabilisation; we encourage the development of theory in which temporal environmental variance plays a central role.},

  abstract = {The paper focused primarily on certain charges, claims, and interpretations of the P value as they relate to CIs and the AIC. It as argued that some of these comparisons and claims are misleading because they ignore key differences in the procedures being compared, such as (1) their primary aims and objectives, (2) the nature of the question posed to the data, as well as (3) the nature of their underlying reasoning and the ensuing inferences. In the case of the P value, the crucial issue is whether Fisher's evidential interpretation of the P value as "indicating the strength of evidence against H0" is appropriate. It is argued that, despite Fisher's maligning of the Type II error, a principled way to provide an adequate evidential account, in the form of post-data severity evaluation, calls for taking into account the power of the test. The error-statistical perspective brings out a key weakness of the P value and addresses several foundational issues raised in frequentist testing, including the fallacies of acceptance and rejection as well as misinterpretations of observed CIs: see Mayo-Spanos (2011). The paper also uncovers the connection between model selection procedures and hypothesis testing, revealing the inherent unreliability of the former. Hence, the choice between different procedures should not be "stylistic" (Murtaugh 2013), but should depend on the questions of interest, the answers sought, and the reliability of the procedures.},

I review some of the more persistent criticisms of P values and argue that most stem from misunderstandings or incorrect interpretations, rather than from intrinsic shortcomings of the P value. I show that P values are intimately linked to confidence intervals and to differences in Akaike's information criterion (deltaAIC), two metrics that have been advocated as replacements for the P value. The choice of a threshold value of deltaAIC that breaks ties among competing models is as arbitrary as the choice of the probability of a Type I error in hypothesis testing, and several other criticisms of the P value apply equally to deltaAIC. Since P values, confidence intervals, and deltaAIC are based on the same statistical information, all have their places in modern statistical practice. The choice of which to use should be stylistic, dictated by details of the application rather than by dogmatic, a priori considerations.},

Here, we provide the first systematic review regarding how floral traits attract vectors (for plant pathogens) or hosts (for animal pathogens), mediate disease establishment and evolve under complex interactions with plant mutualists that can be vectors for microbial antagonists. Attraction of floral visitors is influenced by numerous phenological, morphological and chemical traits, and several plant pathogens manipulate floral traits to attract vectors. There is rapidly growing interest in how floral secondary compounds and antimicrobial enzymes influence disease establishment in plant hosts. Similarly, new research suggests that consumption of floral secondary compounds can reduce pathogen loads in animal pollinators. Given recent concerns about pollinator declines caused in part by pathogens, the role of floral traits in mediating pathogen transmission is a key area for further research. We conclude by discussing important implications of floral transmission of pathogens for agriculture, conservation and human health, suggesting promising avenues for future research in both basic and applied biology.},

We explored the mechanisms by which phenology determines invasion success in a California annual plant community by quantifying how the seasonal timing of growth relates to niche differences that stabilize coexistence, and the competitive ability differences that drive dominance and exclusion. We parameterized models of community dynamics from experimentally assembled annual communities in which exotic plants displayed earlier, coincident, or later phenology than native residents. Using recent theoretical advances from the coexistence literature, we found that differences in phenology promote stabilizing niche differences between exotic and native species. However, phenology was more strongly related to competitive ability differences, allowing later invaders to outcompete earlier native competitors and native residents to outcompete earlier invaders in field experiments. Few of these insights could be inferred by comparing the competitive outcomes across invaders, highlighting the need to quantify niche and competitive ability differences when disentangling how species differences drive invasion success.},

  abstract = {To predict the net impact of climate change on invasions, it is critical to understand how its effects interact with environmental and biotic context. In a factorial field experiment, we examined how increased late-season rainfall influences the growth and reproductive success of two widespread invasive species (Centaurea solstitialis and Aegilops triuncialis) in heterogeneous Californian grasslands, and, in particular, how its impact depends on habitat type, nutrient addition, and competition with resident species. Rainfall enhancement alone exhibited only weak effects, especially in naturally infertile and relatively uninvaded grasslands. In contrast, watering and fertilization together exhibited highly synergistic effects on both invasive species. However, the benefits of the combined treatment were greatly reduced or offset by the presence of surrounding competitors. Our results highlight the roles of nutrient limitation and biotic resistance by resident competitors in constraining the responses of invasive species to changes in rainfall. In systems with strong environmental control by precipitation, enhanced rainfall may promote invasions mainly under nutrient-rich and disturbed conditions, while having lesser effects on nutrient-poor, native "refuges".},

  abstract = {The consequences of deforestation for aboveground biodiversity have been a scientific and political concern for decades. In contrast, despite being a dominant component of biodiversity that is essential to the functioning of ecosystems, the responses of belowground biodiversity to forest removal have received less attention. Single-site studies suggest that soil microbes can be highly responsive to forest removal, but responses are highly variable, with negligible effects in some regions. Using high throughput sequencing, we characterize the effects of deforestation on microbial communities across multiple biomes and explore what determines the vulnerability of microbial communities to this vegetative change. We reveal consistent directional trends in the microbial community response, yet the magnitude of this vegetation effect varied between sites, and was explained strongly by soil texture. In sandy sites, the difference in vegetation type caused shifts in a suite of edaphic characteristics, driving substantial differences in microbial community composition. In contrast, fine-textured soil buffered microbes against these effects and there were minimal differences between communities in forest and grassland soil. These microbial community changes were associated with distinct changes in the microbial catabolic profile, placing community changes in an ecosystem functioning context. The universal nature of these patterns allows us to predict where deforestation will have the strongest effects on soil biodiversity, and how these effects could be mitigated.},

  volume = {95},
  issn = {0012-9658},
  abstract = {Early statistical methods focused on pre-data probability statements (i.e., data as random variables) such as P values; these are not really inferences nor are P values evidential. Statistical science clung to these principles throughout much of the 20th century as a wide variety of methods were developed for special cases. Looking back, it is clear that the underlying paradigm (i.e., testing and P values) was weak. As Kuhn (1970) suggests, new paradigms have taken the place of earlier ones: this is a goal of good science. New methods have been developed and older methods extended and these allow proper measures of strength of evidence and multimodel inference. It is time to move forward with sound theory and practice for the difficult practical problems that lie ahead. Given data the useful foundation shifts to post-data probability statements such as model probabilities (Akaike weights) or related quantities such as odds ratios and likelihood intervals. These new methods allow formal inference from multiple models in the a prior set. These quantities are properly evidential. The past century was aimed at finding the "best" model and making inferences from it. The goal in the 21st century is to base inference on all the models weighted by their model probabilities (model averaging). Estimates of precision can include model selection uncertainty leading to variances conditional on the model set. The 21st century will be about the quantification of information, proper measures of evidence, and multi-model inference. Nelder (1999:261) concludes, "The most important task before us in developing statistical science is to demolish the P-value culture, which has taken root to a frightening extent in many areas of both pure and applied science and technology".},

  abstract = {Biological invasions resulting from international trade can cause major environmental and economic impacts. Propagule pressure is perhaps the most important factor influencing establishment, although actual arrival rates of species are rarely recorded. Furthermore, the pool of potential invaders includes many species that vary in their arrival rate and establishment potential. Therefore, we stress that it is essential to consider the size and composition of species pools arriving from source regions when estimating probabilities of establishment and effects of pathway infestation rates. To address this, we developed a novel framework and modeling approach to enable prediction of future establishments in relation to changes in arrival rate across entire species pools. We utilized 13 828 border interception records from the United States and New Zealand for 444 true bark beetle (Scolytinae) and longhorned beetle (Cerambycidae) species detected between 1949 and 2008 as proxies for arrival rates to model the relationship between arrival and establishment rates. Nonlinearity in this relationship implies that measures intended to reduce the unintended transport of potential invaders (such as phytosanitary treatments) must be highly effective in order to substantially reduce the rate of future invasions, particularly if trade volumes continue to increase.},

  volume = {94},

  abstract = {Understanding how disturbances interact to shape ecosystems is a key challenge in ecology. In forests of western North America, the degree to which recent bark beetle outbreaks and subsequent fires may be linked (e.g., outbreak severity affects fire severity) and/ or whether these two disturbances produce compound effects on postfire succession is of widespread interest. These interactions remain unresolved, largely because field data from actual wildfires following beetle outbreaks are lacking. We studied the 2008 Gunbarrel Fire, which burned 27 200 ha in Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forests that experienced a bark beetle outbreak 4-13 years prefire ("gray stage," after trees have died and needles have dropped), to determine whether outbreak severity influenced subsequent fire severity and postfire tree regeneration. In 85 sample plots we recorded prefire stand structure and outbreak severity; multiple measures of canopy and forest-floor fire severity; and postfire tree seedling density. Prefire outbreak severity was not related to any measure of fire severity except for mean bole scorch, which declined slightly with increasing outbreak severity. Instead, fire severity varied with topography and burning conditions (proxy for weather at time of fire). Postfire Douglas-fir regeneration was low, with tree seedlings absent in 65\% of plots. Tree seedlings were abundant in plots of low fire severity that also had experienced low outbreak severity (mean = 1690 seedlings/ha), suggesting a dual filter on tree regeneration. Although bark beetles and fire collectively reduced live basal area to  5\% and increased snag density to  2000\% of pre-outbreak levels, the lack of relationship between beetle outbreak and fire severity suggests that these disturbances were not linked. Nonetheless, effects on postfire tree regeneration suggest compound disturbance interactions that contribute to the structural heterogeneity characteristic of mid/lower montane forests.},

  volume = {110},
  issn = {1091-6490},
  doi = {10.1073/pnas.1300396110},
  abstract = {For some, the phrase ``forest disturbance'' conjures a vision of bulldozed trees to make room for agricultural fields. For others, the term evokes a mental picture of a tree falling in the forest, creating a gap. In reality, these are two end-members on a continuum of physical disturbances that commonly take place in forests. Critically, the frequency, size, and type of disturbances\textemdash{}the disturbance regime\textemdash{}is a fundamental characteristic of forests associated with processes ranging from carbon and water cycling to the interactions among the flora and fauna (1, 2). As a result, interest in the geography of disturbance has not only increased in forest ecology, it is also recognized in the climate-change science and policy-development arenas (3). In this context, a report by Chambers et al. (4) in PNAS takes us another step forward to determining the geography of natural disturbance in the central Amazon basin. More broadly, their work provides a fresh perspective on ways to address the challenge of quantifying and understanding forest disturbance regimes. Tropical forests undergo a panoply of natural disturbances occurring on multiple\textemdash{} and often interacting\textemdash{}spatial and temporal scales. First, the disturbance regimes of tropical forests are largely defined by a process known as gap-phase dynamics (5) (Fig. 1). When a cluster of trees falls, the newly formed gap is infiltrated by light-harvesting species that fill the newly available space. Eventually the gap pioneers are replaced by slower-growing species, which can live for centuries before falling and creating another gap, thereby initiating the cycle again. Beyond the endogenous and ubiquitous process of gap-phase dynamics, some regions are also prone to much more rare, large-scale natural exogenous events, such as ``blowdowns,'' associated with powerful weather fronts (Fig. 1). Blowdowns are stand-resetting events varying in size from tens to many thousands of hectares, and they have been documented in central Amazonia (6, 7). However, other disturbances are associated with a hybrid of natural endogenous and exogenous processes. For example, droughts can have a differential impact on contrasting growth-forms in tropical forests, and these growth-forms often vary markedly in their likelihood of canopy failure. Vast swaths of southwestern Amazonian forest contain bamboo that undergoes widespread dieback during drought (8, 9), resulting in structural failures that pull neighboring trees to the ground (10). Moreover, disturbance often begets disturbance in tropical forests: a gap created by a felled tree can change the microclimate for neighboring survivors, subsequently leading to additional mortality, a pattern referred to as ``contagion'' (11). The question challenging modern forest ecology in the tropics, and elsewhere, revolves around the precise spatial and temporal frequency of these disturbance events. The importance of quantifying this is hard to overstate: understanding the disturbance regime is requisite to understanding nearly every other ecological process in a forest. For decades, the end-members on the disturbance continuum have been carefully estimated from opposing vantage points. Field plots have been used to estimate rates and patterns of gap-phase dynamics (12, 13). In contrast, large disturbances\textemdash{}those driven by humans, such as logging and fire, as well as natural events like blowdowns\textemdash{}have been mapped at the stand-offish distances afforded by satellite sensors (6, 14). Integrating these approaches, and filling in the continuum of disturbance sizes and frequencies between these extremes, ends up being the biggest challenge of all. Chambers et al. (4) present a unique approach to achieving this goal by combining field work, satellite observations, and a probabilistic simulation model. In doing so, they gain a spatially and temporally explicit understanding of a fuller disturbance spectrum for an old-growth forest near Manaus, Brazil. Their simulation results suggest that longterm increases in carbon sequestration driven by growth are punctuated by stand-resetting disturbance events of varying size and frequency, many of which are larger in scale than the gap-phase dynamics apparent in field plots. A useful byproduct of their analysis is a minimum bound on the size of a field plot that would be necessary to pick up these large, infrequent events. The authors estimate that plots larger than 10 ha would provide the greatest sensitivity (Fig. 1), which stands in stark contrast to nearly every permanent sampling plot found in the Amazon today, each of which is usually less than 1 ha in size (15). Chambers et al. (4) also tell us that very large natural disturbance events of 4\textendash{}10 ha in size (equivalent to about 600\textendash{}2,700 trees per event) are rare in the central Amazon. Their simulations suggest that these events occur at a given 1-ha patch of forest once in 20,000\textendash{}330,000 y. Given the mismatch between these very rare events and the median estimated tree age of 175 y, these largest of disturbances may not play a big role in biasing the estimated Amazon carbon sink reported from smaller field-plot and micrometeorological tower measurements (16\textendash{}18). However, it is the middle portion of the gap-size frequency continuum\textemdash{}the events larger than single-tree falls but smaller than the very largest and rarest disturbances\textemdash{} that may create the most uncertainty in long-term carbon sequestration studies. In central Amazonia, Chambers et al. (4) estimate that disturbances of about 15\textendash{}40 trees per event occur every 50\textendash{}200 y in a given hectare of forest. Most tropical forest plots have been monitored for less than 25 y (19), and so these events will be hard to incorporate into calculations based on field work alone. The impact of these events on net carbon uptake is profound: these disturbances wind back the clock at a spatial scale and temporal frequency that challenges current measurement and modeling efforts. Indeed, given the limited size of most field plots, such disturbance events will require large-area mapping at high spatial resolution (20) to improve upon these early estimates by Chambers et al. Although the Chambers et al. (4) study helps us to fill out the forest disturbance continuum in one portion of Amazonia, caution must be exercised when considering the extent to which their results can be extrapolated to other regions. Both the drivers of disturbance and the subsequent biotic responses vary geographically. For example, the Brazilian region of focus for Chambers et al. (4) is a known alley of squall line activity (7, 21), and the large-scale blowdowns they observe may be less prevalent in other regions of the Amazon. Similarly, gap-size frequency distributions vary by forest physiognomy (22), and Amazonian canopies span an impressive range of architectures, floristic composition, and biomass levels (23, 24). Finally, disturbance research will need to address subcanopy losses\textemdash{}branches of trees\textemdash{} in a spatially explicit way to account for this potentially major contributor to the carbon dynamics of forests (25). These and still other factors require additional study in the effort to develop a global geography of forest disturbance.},

  doi = {10.1890/13-0032.1},
  abstract = {Extensive changes in montane forest structure have occurred throughout the U.S. Southwest following Euro-American settlement. These changes are a product of confounding effects of disturbance, climate variability, species competition, and modern land use changes. Pronounced forest reproduction events in the Southwest have generally occurred in climatically wet periods but have also followed widespread fire exclusion. Understanding the ecological processes driving such events has important implications for forest restoration, although these efforts remain difficult due to confounding factors. Separation of these interacting factors was possible in the Sierra San Luis of northern Mexico where we investigated climate, fire, and tree recruitment in areas with continued frequent fires or where fire exclusion came relatively late (1940s). Fires were strongly tied to interannual wet-dry cycles of climate, whereas recruitment peaks were more closely tied to local processes, namely, fire-free periods, than to broad-scale climatically wet conditions. The greatest pulse of tree recruitment coincided with a pronounced mid-century drought (1942-1957) and a period of reduced fire frequency. The second largest pulse of recruitment (ca. 1900) preceded a well-documented period of recruitment (and an anomalously wet period) elsewhere across the Southwest in the 1910s-1920s, and also coincided with specific fire-free periods during below-average precipitation. We also found greater spatial dependence and clustering in older age classes of trees. This spatial pattern indicates a legacy of fire-induced mortality in shaping stand structure, underscoring the importance of frequent fire effects on spatial variability in forests.},

  abstract = {We studied vegetation composition and structure in a mixed conifer-oak ecosystem across a range of fire severity 10 years following wildfire. Sample plots centered on focal California black oaks (Quercus kelloggii) were established to evaluate oak and neighboring tree and shrub recovery across a gradient of fire severity in the southern Cascade Range, USA. Shrub and oak resprouting was strongest around focal oaks where conifer mortality was greatest. Linear modeling revealed negative relationships between California black oak sprout height or basal area and residual overstory tree survival, primarily white fir (Abies concolor). The two dominant competing species, California black oak and white fir, showed opposite responses to fire severity. Sprouting California black oak and associated shrubs dominated in severely burned areas, while surviving, non-sprouting white fir maintained dominance by its height advantage and shading effects in areas that burned with low fire severity. Our results indicate that high-severity fire promotes persistence and restoration of ecosystems containing resprouting species, such as California black oak, that are increasingly rare due to widespread fire exclusion in landscapes that historically experienced more frequent fire. We present a conceptual model based on our results and supported by a synthesis of postfire resprouting dynamics literature. Our results and conceptual model help illuminate long-term postfire vegetation responses and the potential ability of fire to catalyze formation of alternate vegetation community structures that may not be apparent in studies that evaluate postfire effects at shorter time-since-fire intervals or at coarser scales.},

  doi = {10.1890/13-0086.1},
  abstract = {How pathogen spillover influences host community diversity and composition is poorly understood. Spillover occurs when transmission from a reservoir host species drives infection in another host species. In cheatgrass-invaded grasslands in the western United States, a fungal seed pathogen, black fingers of death (Pyrenophora semeniperda), spills over from exotic cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) to native perennial bunchgrasses such as squirreltail (Elymus elymoides). Previous theoretical work based on this system predicts that pathogens that spill over can favor either host coexistence, the exclusion of either host species, or priority effects, depending on species-specific transmission rates and pathogen tolerance. Here, these model predictions were tested by parameterizing a population growth model with field data from Skull Valley, Utah, USA. The model suggests that, across the observed range of demographic variation, the pathogen is most likely to provide a net benefit to squirreltail and a net cost to cheatgrass, though both effects are relatively weak. Although cheatgrass (the reservoir host) is more tolerant, squirreltail is far less susceptible to infection, and its long-lived adult stage buffers population growth against seed losses to the pathogen. This work shows that, despite pathogen spillover, the shared pathogen promotes native grass persistence by reducing exotic grass competition. Counterintuitively, the reservoir host does not necessarily benefit from the presence of the pathogen, and may even suffer greater costs than the nonreservoir host. Understanding the consequences of shared pathogens for host communities requires weighing species differences in susceptibility, transmission, and tolerance using quantitative models.},

  abstract = {Aim To determine if differences in climate envelopes for six coniferous tree species and two life stages (trees and seedlings) suggest a potential for species range con- tractions, expansions or shifts in response to climate change and if these patterns differ between subalpine (i.e. cool-climate) and montane (i.e. warm-climate) species. Location The dry domain of the western United States. Methods Using data from the Forest Inventory and Analysis National Program, we quantified the relationship between probability of occurrence and climate for adults and seedlings of each species with a Bayesian logistic regression. Assuming that distributional differences between life stages highlight shifting regeneration patterns relative to adult trees, we assessed differences between seedlings and adult trees based on predicted probabilities of occurrence and climate envelope boundaries. Results Differences between occurrence probabilities for seedlings and adults were greatest for montane, as opposed to subalpine, species and along range margins, especially in the southern and western portions of the study area. Climate envelope boundaries of seedlings differed from adult trees most frequently in montane species and often suggested range contractions or range shifts, as opposed to range expansion. Main conclusions Our results indicated that climate-induced contractions and shifts in seedling distribution in response to recent change are already under way and are particularly severe in montane tree species.While adult treesmay persist for hundreds of years without significant regeneration, tree species ranges will even- tually contract where tree regeneration fails.

Here, we use classical coexistence theory to reframe the debate in terms of stabilizing mechanisms (niches) and fitness equivalence (neutrality). The neutral model is a special case where stabilizing mechanisms are absent and species have equivalent fitness. Instead of asking whether niches or neutral processes structure communities, we advocate determining the degree to which observed diversity reflects strong stabilizing mechanisms overcoming large fitness differences or weak stabilization operating on species of similar fitness. To answer this question, we propose combining data on per capita growth rates with models to: (i) quantify the strength of stabilizing processes; (ii) quantify fitness inequality and compare it with stabilization; and (iii) manipulate frequency dependence in growth to test the consequences of stabilization and fitness equivalence for coexistence.},

  abstract = {The focus of most ideas on diversity maintenance is species coexistence, which may be stable or unstable. Stable coexistence can be quantified by the long-term rates at which community members recover from low density. Quantifica- tion shows that coexistence mechanisms function in two major ways: They may be (a) equalizing because they tend to minimize average fitness differences between species, or (b) stabilizing because they tend to increase negative intraspecific inter- actions relative to negative interspecific interactions. Stabilizing mechanisms are es- sential for species coexistence and include traditional mechanisms such as resource partitioning and frequency-dependent predation, as well as mechanisms that depend on fluctuations in population densities and environmental factors in space and time. Equalizing mechanisms contribute to stable coexistence because they reduce large average fitness inequalities which might negate the effects of stabilizing mechanisms. Models of unstable coexitence, in which species diversity slowly decays over time, have focused almost exclusively on equalizing mechanisms. These models would be more robust if they also included stabilizing mechanisms, which arise in many and varied ways but need not be adequate for full stability of a system. Models of unstable coex- istence invite a broader view of diversity maintenance incorporating species turnover.},

  abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are increasingly proposed to support conservation decision making. However, evidence of SDMs supporting solutions for on-ground conservation problems is still scarce in the scientific literature. Here, we show that successful examples exist but are still largely hidden in the grey literature, and thus less accessible for analysis and learning. Furthermore, the decision framework within which SDMs are used is rarely made explicit. Using case studies from biological invasions, identification of critical habitats, reserve selection and translocation of endangered species, we propose that SDMs may be tailored to suit a range of decision-making contexts when used within a structured and transparent decision-making process. To construct appropriate SDMs to more effectively guide conservation actions, modellers need to better understand the decision process, and decision makers need to provide feedback to modellers regarding the actual use of SDMs to support conservation decisions. This could be facilitated by individuals or institutions playing the role of 'translators' between modellers and decision makers. We encourage species distribution modellers to get involved in real decision-making processes that will benefit from their technical input; this strategy has the potential to better bridge theory and practice, and contribute to improve both scientific knowledge and conservation outcomes.},

  abstract = {Broad-scale maps of forest characteristics are needed throughout the United States for a wide variety of forest land management applications. Inexpensive maps can be produced by modelling forest class and structure variables collected in nationwide forest inventories as functions of satellite-based information. But little work has been directed at comparing modelling techniques to determine which tools are best suited to mapping tasks given multiple objectives and logistical constraints. Consequently, five modelling techniques were compared for mapping forest characteristics in the Interior Western United States. The modelling techniques included linear models (LMs), generalized additive models (GAMs), classification and regression trees (CARTs), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), and artificial neural networks (ANNs). Models were built for two discrete and four continuous forest response variables using a variety of satellite-based predictor variables within each of five ecologically different regions. All techniques proved themselves workable in an automated environment. When their potential mapping ability was explored through simulations, tremendous advantages were seen in use of MARS and ANN for prediction over LMs, GAMs, and CART. However, much smaller differences were seen when using real data. In some instances, a simple linear approach worked virtually as well as the more complex models, while small gains were seen using more complex models in other instances. In real data runs, MARS and GAMS performed (marginally) best for prediction of forest characteristics. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Greenhouse gas emissions have significantly altered global climate, and will continue to do so in the future. Increases in the frequency, duration, and/or severity of drought and heat stress associated with climate change could fundamentally alter the composition, structure, and biogeography of forests in many regions. Of particular concern are potential increases in tree mortality associated with climate-induced physiological stress and interactions with other climate-mediated processes such as insect outbreaks and wildfire. Despite this risk, existing projections of tree mortality are based on models that lack functionally realistic mortality mechanisms, and there has been no attempt to track observations of climate-driven tree mortality globally. Here we present the first global assessment of recent tree mortality attributed to drought and heat stress. Although episodic mortality occurs in the absence of climate change, studies compiled here suggest that at least some of the world's forested ecosystems already may be responding to climate change and raise concern that forests may become increasingly vulnerable to higher background tree mortality rates and die-off in response to future warming and drought, even in environments that are not normally considered water-limited. This further suggests risks to ecosystem services, including the loss of sequestered forest carbon and associated atmospheric feedbacks. Our review also identifies key information gaps and scientific uncertainties that currently hinder our ability to predict tree mortality in response to climate change and emphasizes the need for a globally coordinated observation system. Overall, our review reveals the potential for amplified tree mortality due to drought and heat in forests worldwide.},

  abstract = {Predicting population establishment based on initial population size is a theoretically and empirically challenging problem whose resolution informs a multitude of applications. Indeed, it is a central problem in the management of introduced, endangered, harvested, and pathogenic organisms. We focus here on introduced species. We synthesize the current state of modeling in this predictive enterprise and outline future directions in the application of these models to developing regulations intended to prevent the establishment of invaders. Descriptive and mechanistic models of single-population introductions are fairly well developed and have provided insight into invasion risk in laboratory and field conditions. However, many invasions stem from large-scale and repeated releases of a multitude of species from relatively indiscriminate invasion vectors associated with international trade and travel. Vector-scale models of invasion risk are less well developed and are characterized largely by the use of untested proxy variables for propagule pressure. We illustrate the problems associated with proxy variables and introduce a more mechanistic theoretical formulation characterizing vector-scale invasion pressure in terms of propagule pressure (number of introduced individuals) and colonization pressure (number of introduced species). We outline key questions to be addressed in applying both single-population and vector-scale models to the development of threshold-based invasion regulations. We illustrate these ecological and applied questions using examples from terrestrial, aquatic, and marine systems. We develop in detail examples from ballast-water transport that, as one of the best-characterized global invasion vectors and one that is subject to emerging international threshold-based biosecurity regulations, provides a rich case study.},

  abstract = {This study investigates patterns of plant diversity following wildfires in fire-prone shrublands of California, seeks to understand those patterns in terms of both local and landscape factors, and considers the implications for fire management. Ninety study sites were established following extensive wildfires in 1993, and 1000-m(2) plots were used to sample a variety of parameters. Data on community responses were collected for five years following fire. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to relate plant species richness to plant abundance, fire severity, abiotic conditions, within-plot heterogeneity, stand age, and position in the landscape. Temporal dynamics of average richness response was also modeled. Richness was highest in the first year following fire, indicating postfire enhancement of diversity. A general decline in richness over time was detected, with year-to-year variation attributable to annual variations in precipitation. Peak richness in the landscape was found where (1) plant abundance was moderately high, (2) within-plot heterogeneity was high, (3) soils were moderately low in nitrogen, high in sand content, and with high rock cover, (4) fire severity was low, and (5) stands were young prior to fire. Many of these characteristics were correlated with position in the landscape and associated conditions. We infer from the SEM results that postfire richness in this system is strongly influenced by local conditions and that these conditions are, in turn, predictably related to landscape-level conditions. For example, we observed that older stands of shrubs were characterized by more severe fires, which were associated with a low recovery of plant cover and low richness. These results may have implications for the use of prescribed fire in this system if these findings extrapolate to prescribed burns as we would expect.},

Recent research, however, indicates that host susceptibility should be considered carefully if we are to understand the mechanism by which parasite dynamics influence host dynamics and vice versa. Studies in insects, fish, amphibians and rodents show that infection occurrence and intensity are more probable and more severe in individuals with an underlying poor condition. Moreover, infection itself results in further deterioration of the host and a 'vicious circle' is created. We argue that this potential synergy between host susceptibility and infection should be more widely acknowledged in disease ecology research.},

However, variation in species' influence due to species and interactions turnover can have important consequences for host community dynamics and/or for parasite transmission dynamics, and eventually for the risk of zoonotic diseases. We used data on a network of small mammals and their ectoparasites surveyed over 6 years to test hypotheses exploring (i) the temporal variability in direct and indirect influences species exert on each other in a community, and (ii) the differences in temporal variability of direct/indirect influences between temporally persistent (TP) and temporally intermittent species. We modelled the temporal variation in (i) direct reciprocal influence between hosts and parasites (hosts providing resources to parasites and parasites exploiting the resources of hosts), using an asymmetry index, and (ii) indirect influence among species within a community (e.g. facilitation of parasite infestation by other parasites), using betweenness centrality. We also correlated asymmetry and centrality to examine the relationship between them. Network dynamics was determined by TP species but even those species had strong among-species heterogeneity in the temporal variation of the direct/indirect effects they exerted. In addition, there was a significant positive linear correlation between asymmetry and centrality. We conclude that the temporal dynamics of host-parasite interactions is driven by TP hosts. However, even within this group of persistent species, some exhibit large temporal variation, such that the functional roles they play (e.g. in promoting parasite transmission) change over time. In addition, parasites having a large negative impact on hosts are also those facilitating the spread of other parasites through the entire host community. Our results provide new insights into community dynamics and can be applied in the management of antagonistic networks aimed at preventing disease outbreaks.},

By contrast, mechanistic models incorporate explicit relationships between environmental conditions and organismal performance, estimated independently of current distributions. Mechanistic approaches include models that translate environmental conditions into biologically relevant metrics (e.g. potential duration of activity), models that capture environmental sensitivities of survivorship and fecundity, and models that use energetics to link environmental conditions and demography. We compared how two correlative and three mechanistic models predicted the ranges of two species: a skipper butterfly (Atalopedes campestris) and a fence lizard (Sceloporus undulatus). Correlative and mechanistic models performed similarly in predicting current distributions, but mechanistic models predicted larger range shifts in response to climate change. Although mechanistic models theoretically should provide more accurate distribution predictions, there is much potential for improving their flexibility and performance.},

  abstract = {Tree species are predicted to track future climate by shifting their geographic distributions, but climate-mediated migrations are not apparent in a recent continental-scale analysis. To better understand the mechanisms of a possible migration lag, we analyzed relative recruitment patterns by comparing juvenile and adult tree abundances in climate space. One would expect relative recruitment to be higher in cold and dry climates as a result of tree migration with juveniles located further poleward than adults. Alternatively, relative recruitment could be higher in warm and wet climates as a result of higher tree population turnover with increased temperature and precipitation. Using the USDA Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis data at regional scales, we jointly modeled juvenile and adult abundance distributions for 65 tree species in climate space of the eastern United States. We directly compared the optimal climate conditions for juveniles and adults, identified the climates where each species has high relative recruitment, and synthesized relative recruitment patterns across species. Results suggest that for 77\% and 83\% of the tree species, juveniles have higher optimal temperature and optimal precipitation, respectively, than adults. Across species, the relative recruitment pattern is dominated by relatively more abundant juveniles than adults in warm and wet climates. These different abundance-climate responses through life history are consistent with faster population turnover and inconsistent with the geographic trend of large-scale tree migration. Taken together, this juvenile-adult analysis suggests that tree species might respond to climate change by having faster turnover as dynamics respond to longer growing seasons and higher temperatures, before there is evidence of poleward migration at biogeographic scales.

  abstract = {Pathogens and herbivores can severely reduce host fitness, potentially leading to altered succession rates and changes in plant community composition. Thus, to predict vegetation dynamics under climate change, it is necessary to understand how plant path- ogens and herbivores will respond. Pathogens and herbivores are predicted to increase under climate warming because the amount of time available for growth and reproduction will increase. To test this prediction, we used a warming experiment in which heaters were suspended over a natural montane meadow for 12 years. In the summer of 2002, we quantified damage by all the observable (aboveground) pathogens and herbivores on six of the most common plant species (Artemisia tridentata, Helianthella quinquenervis, Erig- eron speciosus, Potentilla gracilis, Potentilla hippiana, and Lathyrus leucanthus).We found that plants in the earlier melting plots generally had the most damage and were attacked by a larger number of species, which is consistent with predictions. However, although the overall trend was an increase in damage with warmer temperatures and earlier snowmelt, some pathogens and herbivores performed better in cooler or later melting plots. The idiosyncratic response of each species to environmental conditions suggests that there are likely to be changes in community composition as the planet warms.},

At the scale of the individual plant, enough experiments have been performed to begin synthesizing the effects of climate variables on infection rates, though pathosystem-specific characteristics make synthesis challenging. Models of plant disease have now been developed to incorporate more sophisticated climate predictions. At the population level, the adaptive potential of plant and pathogen populations may prove to be one of the most important predictors of the magnitude of climate change effects. Ecosystem ecologists are now addressing the role of plant disease in ecosystem processes and the challenge of scaling up from individual infection probabilities to epidemics and broader impacts.},

Plant host-pathogen interactions provide good examples of coevolutionary systems where both numerical and genetic dynamics have been explicitly investigated in a spatial context and where genes under selection can be unambiguously identified. In this article, we focus on long-term studies of several natural host-pathogen inter- actions that span a range of life histories and taxa. We use these studies to evaluate some predictions for numerical and genetic pat- terns at local and regional scales. Specifically, we examine the degree of among-population asynchrony in disease presence/absence and abundance, and the extent to which this is a function of isolation. For one host-pathogen interaction (Linum-Melampsora), we focus on whether there is local correspondence between resistance and virulence genes (as would be predicted by single-population co- evolutionary models) or whether such correspondence occurs at larger spatial scales. Finally, we discuss the implications of these studies with respect to the impact of host and pathogen life-history variation on the spatial scale of coevolutionary interactions. Under- standing coevolutionary interactions in nature requires a multidis- ciplinary approach, including long-termempirical studies of multiple populations and computer modeling.},

  abstract = {Aim Our aim was to map the climate dependence of tree species distributions (probability of occurrence) and forest growth (net primary productivity) by comparing the congruence and incongruence between correlative and process-based modelling approaches. Location Iberian Peninsula, south-western Europe. Methods We used forest inventory data for three widespread tree species (Quercus ilex, Pinus halepensis and Pinus sylvestris) to model climatic suitability with an ensemble of seven correlative species distribution models (using biomod). We then simulated forest net primary productivity (NPP) as a surrogate of forest growth for forests of each species using an ecophysiological process-based model (gotilwa+) along a gradient of climatic suitability. The spatial distribution of the growth estimates was then compared with that of the suitability estimates, and robust regression was used to classify regions in terms of model congruence. Results Quercus ilex and P. sylvestris both showed a positive relationship between forest NPP and climatic suitability. The main discrepancies were found in the north of the peninsula, where there was high potential forest growth but low climate suitability. Low forest-growth estimates in areas of high suitability only appeared for P. sylvestris in southern montane regions. Pinus halepensis always showed a negative relationship between estimated growth and climatic suitability. The analysis of other ecophysiological parameters (mean leaf life and leaf area index) suggests that this tree species has different physiological strategies that allow differential growth rates in areas of low suitability. Main conclusions We found that the relationship between estimated growth and distribution varies strongly in different areas and species. Mapping the incongruences between the predicted climatic suitability and growth allowed us to identify regions where other factors (e.g. biotic interactions) may be more significant than the physiological limits on growth. We show that new insights into species distributions can be gained from mapping the differences between correlative and process-based models.},

How is the effect of GCC on genetic diversity currently studied? Where is potential for future research? For each of these questions, we provide a general background and highlight case studies across the animal, plant and microbial kingdoms.

The historical range of variability (HRV) concept evolved as a management target for natural vegetation composition and fire regimes in fire-prone ecosystems. HRV-based management inherently assumes that ecosystem resilience is reflected in observed ranges of past vegetation and fire dynamics, typically without knowledge of where thresholds exist beyond these dynamics. Given uncertainty in future conditions, some have argued that HRV may not adequately reflect ecosystem resilience to future fire activity. We suggest a refinement that includes concepts from the thresholds of potential concern (TPC) framework, which emphasizes tipping points at the extremes of ecosystem dynamics and other socially unacceptable outcomes. We propose bounded ranges of variation (BRV), an approach focused on building resilience by using historical information, but also by identifying socio-ecological thresholds to avoid and associated management action triggers. Here, we examine nonnative species and carbon sequestration as examples of how the BRV framework could be used in the context of conservation and fire management.},

Native species' richness and productivity were initially reduced by hogweed invasion but tended to recover after \~30 years of hogweed residence at the sites. Hogweed cover declined over the whole period assessed. A complementary common garden experiment suggested that the dynamics observed in the field were due to a negative plant-soil feedback; hogweed survival and biomass, and its competitive ability were lower when growing in soil inocula collected from earlier-invaded grasslands.

We mod- elled the evolution of virulence of a generalist plant virus, Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) over two hosts, in which CMV genotypes differ for within-host multipli- cation and virulence. According to knowledge on CMV biology over different hosts, the model allows for inoculum flows between hosts and for host co-infec- tion by competing virus genotypes, competition affecting transmission rates to new hosts. Parameters of within-host multiplication, within-host competition, virulence and transmission were determined experimentally for different CMV genotypes in each host. Emergence of highly virulent genotypes was predicted to occur as mixed infections, favoured by high vector densities. For most simulated conditions, evolution to high virulence in the more competent Host 1 was little dependent on inoculum flow from Host 2, while in Host 2, it depended on trans- mission from Host 1. Virulence evolution bifurcated in each host at low, but not at high, vector densities. There was no evidence of between-host trade-offs in CMV life-history traits, at odds with most theoretical assumptions. Predictions agreed with field observations and are relevant for designing control strategies for multihost plant viruses.},

Landscape ecology, which deals with the mosaic structure of landscapes and ecosystems, considers the spatial heterogeneity of biotic and abiotic components as the underlying mechanism which determines the structure of ecosystems. The methodologies of GIS, GPS, satellite imagery, and spatial statistics, and the landscape ecology--epidemiology approach are described, and applications of these methodologies to vector-borne diseases are reviewed. Collaborative studies by the author and colleagues on malaria in Israel and tsetse flies in Kenya, and Lyme disease, LaCrosse encephalitis, and eastern equine encephalitis in the north-central United States are presented as examples for application of these tools to research and disease surveillance. Relevance of spatial tools and landscape ecology to emerging infectious diseases and to studies of global change effects on vector-borne diseases are discussed.},

  abstract = {Introduced plant populations lose interactions with enemies, mutualists and competitors from their native ranges, and gain interactions with new species, under new abiotic conditions. From a biogeographical perspective, differences in the assemblage of interacting species, as well as in abiotic conditions, may explain the demographic success of the introduced plant populations relative to conspecifics in their native range. Within invaded communities, the new interactions and conditions experienced by the invader may influence both its demographic success and its effects on native biodiversity. Here, we examine indirect effects involving enemies, mutualists and competitors of introduced plants, and effects of abiotic conditions on biotic interactions. We then synthesize ideas building on Darwin's idea that the kinds of new interactions gained by an introduced population will depend on its relatedness to native populations. This yields a heuristic framework to explain how biotic interactions and abiotic conditions influence invader success. We conclude that species introductions generally alter plants' interactions with enemies, mutualists and competitors, and that there is increasing evidence that these altered interactions jointly influence the success of introduced populations.},

  abstract = {Aim. Top-down (climatic) controls of fire occurrence are expected to homoge- nize fire regimes in a given area over long (millennial) temporal scales. Previous investigations in south-eastern British Columbia have shown that bottom-up (local site) factors can override long-term climate as a dominant control. Here, we examine the interactions between fire regime controls using five 5000-year-long lake sediment records. Location. All lakes are located in separate watersheds within a 550-km2 region of Engelmann spruce\textendash{}subalpine fir forest in the Columbia Mountains, British Columbia, Canada. Methods. Sedimentary macroscopic ( 150 lm) charcoal analysis was used to produce local fire history records. Fire events were identified by decomposing the charcoal concentration series using the program CharAnalysis. We analysed the temporal coherence of the reconstructed fire events and the distribu- tions of the fire return intervals at all sites and pooled sites by their north- facing or south-facing aspect. Results. Since 5000 cal. yr bp, fire frequency was highest between 4250 and 2750 cal. yr bp and lowest from 750 cal. yr bp to the present. Median fire return intervals were shorter on the warmer and drier south-facing slopes (135\textendash{}190 years) and longer on the cooler and moister north-facing slopes (226\textendash{}241 years). Significant synchrony existed between sites with similar aspect, but no synchrony was found at sites with opposing aspect, providing evidence for the importance of bottom-up controls. Smoothed fire frequencies suggested that the influence of aspect varied throughout the period and that the importance of aspect could be overridden by other controls. The asyn- chrony between sites with opposite aspects suggests that local conditions for fire are important spatial controls on the fire regime. Main conclusions. Aspect is an important bottom-up control of fire regimes in mid-elevation forests and its influence varies through time. The variability of climate\textendash{}fire\textendash{}vegetation interactions in the region needs to be investigated to understand the importance of top-down and bottom-up controls.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Aim Tree growth may be enhanced by carbon dioxide fertilization unless drought stress becomes too severe, yet the likely increase in tree growth under a warmer climate is still controversial. Tree mortality has increased in some regions, but its multifactorial naturemakes the prediction of likely global trends difficult.The aims of this work are: (1) to assess which abiotic, structural and competition factors influence tree growth and tree mortality in mainland Spain, and (2) to evaluate whether these processes would drive species distributions and would improve current niche model predictions. Location Continental Spain. Methods We projected species distributionalmodels by integrating nonparamet- ric tree growth and treemortality models based on repeated surveys of diameter at breast height and mortality for 40,721 trees distributed in 45,301 plots, which include the 11 most common canopy tree species in continental Spain, as measured in the secondand third National Forest Inventories,with ameanlag time of 11 years. Results Tree growth and treemortality were explained by an assemblage of many factors, among which climate and competition played a key role. The accuracy of models including tree growth and tree mortality in predicting tree habitat suitabil- ity was comparable to classical niche models based on species occurrence. Projec- tions under climate change showed for 9 out of 11 species, a likely increase in tree growth that would be counteracted by an increase in treemortality, suggesting that even if growth rates increase,mortality would limit the species ranges under global warming expectations. Main conclusions Growth and mortality are major determinants of species distributions. Under future climate changeexpectations, ourmodelsuggeststhat growth may increase for some Iberian species, but even in this case, species ranges at the rear edge would be limited by an increase in mortality rates.},

  abstract = {Malaria vector control targeting the larval stages of mosquitoes was applied successfully against many species of Anopheles (Diptera: Culicidae) in malarious countries until the mid-20th Century. Since the introduction of DDT in the 1940s and the associated development of indoor residual spraying (IRS), which usually has a more powerful impact than larval control on vectorial capacity, the focus of malaria prevention programmes has shifted to the control of adult vectors. In the Afrotropical Region, where malaria is transmitted mainly by Anopheles funestus Giles and members of the Anopheles gambiae Giles complex, gaps in information on larval ecology and the ability of An. gambiae sensu lato to exploit a wide variety of larval habitats have discouraged efforts to develop and implement larval control strategies. Opportunities to complement adulticiding with other components of integrated vector management, along with concerns about insecticide resistance, environmental impacts, rising costs of IRS and logistical constraints, have stimulated renewed interest in larval control of malaria vectors. Techniques include environmental management, involving the temporary or permanent removal of anopheline larval habitats, as well as larviciding with chemical or biological agents. This present review covers large-scale trials of anopheline larval control methods, focusing on field studies in Africa conducted within the past 15 years. Although such studies are limited in number and scope, their results suggest that targeting larvae, particularly in human-made habitats, can significantly reduce malaria transmission in appropriate settings. These approaches are especially suitable for urban areas, where larval habitats are limited, particularly when applied in conjunction with IRS and other adulticidal measures, such as the use of insecticide treated bednets.},

  abstract = {The management of wildlife hosts for controlling parasites and disease has a history of mixed success. Deer can be important hosts for ticks, such as Ixodes ricinus, which is the primary vector of disease-causing zoonotic pathogens in Europe. Deer are generally managed by culling and fencing for forestry protection, habitat conservation, and commercial hunting, and in this study we test whether these deer management methods can be useful for controlling ticks, with implications for tick-borne pathogens. At different spatial scales and habitats we tested the hypotheses that tick abundance is reduced by (1) culling deer and (2) deer exclusion using fencing. We compared abundance indices of hosts and questing I. ricinus nymphs using a combination of small-scale fencing experiments on moorland, a large-scale natural experiment of fenced and unfenced pairs of forests, and cross-sectional surveys of forest and moorland areas with varying deer densities. As predicted, areas with fewer deer had fewer ticks, and fenced exclosures had dramatically fewer ticks in both large-scale forest and small-scale moorland plots. Fencing and reducing deer density were also associated with higher ground vegetation. The implications of these results on other hosts, pathogen prevalence, and disease risk are discussed. This study provides evidence of how traditional management methods of a keystone species can reduce a generalist parasite, with implications for disease risk mitigation.},

  abstract = {Lyme disease is the most prevalent vector-borne disease in North America, and both the annual incidence and geographic range are increasing. The emergence of Lyme disease has been attributed to a century-long recovery of deer, an important reproductive host for adult ticks. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that Lyme disease risk may now be more dynamically linked to fluctua- tions in the abundance of small-mammal hosts that are thought to infect the majority of ticks. The continuing and rapid increase in Lyme disease over the past two decades, long after the recoloniza- tion of deer, suggests that other factors, including changes in the ecology of small-mammal hosts may be responsible for the con- tinuingemergence of Lyme disease.We present a theoreticalmodel that illustrates how reductions in small-mammal predators can sharply increase Lyme disease risk.We then show that increases in Lyme disease in the northeastern and midwestern United States over the past three decades are frequently uncorrelated with deer abundance and instead coincide with a range-wide decline of a key small-mammal predator, the red fox, likely due to expansion of coyote populations. Further, across four states we find poor spatial correlation between deer abundance and Lyme disease incidence, but coyote abundance and fox rarity effectively predict the spatial distribution ofLyme disease inNewYork. These results suggest that changes in predator communities may have cascading impacts that facilitate the emergence of zoonotic diseases, the vast majority of which rely on hosts that occupy low trophic levels.},

  abstract = {Understanding interactions between mobile species distributions and landcover characteristics remains an outstanding challenge in ecology. Multiple factors could explain species distributions including endogenous evolutionary traits leading to conspecific clustering and endogenous habitat features that support life history requirements. Birds are a useful taxon for examining hypotheses about the relative importance of these factors among species in a community. We developed a hierarchical Bayes approach to model the relationships between bird species occupancy and local landcover variables accounting for spatial autocorrelation, species similarities, and partial observability. We fit alternative occupancy models to detections of 90 bird species observed during repeat visits to 316 point-counts forming a 400-m grid throughout the Patuxent Wildlife Research Refuge in Maryland, USA. Models with landcover variables performed significantly better than our autologistic and null models, supporting the hypothesis that local landcover heterogeneity is important as an exogenous driver for species distributions. Conspecific clustering alone was a comparatively poor descriptor of local community composition, but there was evidence for spatial autocorrelation in all species. Considerable uncertainty remains whether landcover combined with spatial autocorrelation is most parsimonious for describing bird species distributions at a local scale. Spatial structuring may be weaker at intermediate scales within which dispersal is less frequent, information flows are localized, and landcover types become spatially diversified and therefore exhibit little aggregation. Examining such hypotheses across species assemblages contributes to our understanding of community-level associations with conspecifics and landscape composition.},

  abstract = {Many of the most interesting questions ecologists ask lead to analyses of spatial data. Yet, perhaps confused by the large number of statistical models and fitting methods available, many ecologists seem to believe this is best left to specialists. Here, we describe the issues that need consideration when analysing spatial data and illustrate these using simulation studies. Our comparative analysis involves using methods including generalized least squares, spatial filters, wavelet revised models, conditional autoregressive models and generalized additive mixed models to estimate regression coefficients from synthetic but realistic data sets, including some which violate standard regression assumptions. We assess the performance of each method using two measures and using statistical error rates for model selection. Methods that performed well included generalized least squares family of models and a Bayesian implementation of the conditional auto-regressive model. Ordinary least squares also performed adequately in the absence of model selection, but had poorly controlled Type I error rates and so did not show the improvements in performance under model selection when using the above methods. Removing large-scale spatial trends in the response led to poor performance. These are empirical results; hence extrapolation of these findings to other situations should be performed cautiously. Nevertheless, our simulation-based approach provides much stronger evidence for comparative analysis than assessments based on single or small numbers of data sets, and should be considered a necessary foundation for statements of this type in future.},

  abstract = {Long-distance dispersal (LDD) of seeds and pollen shapes the spatial dynamics of plant genotypes, populations and communities. Quantifying LDD is thus important for predicting the future dynamics of plants exposed to environmental changes. However, environmental changes can also alter the behaviour of LDD vectors: for instance, increasing air temperature may enhance atmospheric instability, thereby altering the turbulent airflow that transports seed and pollen. Here, we investigate temperature effects on wind dispersal in a boreal forest using a 10-year time series of micrometeorological measurements and a Lagrangian stochastic model for particle transport. For a wide range of dispersal and life history types, we found positive relations between air temperature and LDD. This translates into a largely consistent positive effect of +3 degrees C warming on predicted LDD frequencies and spread rates of plants. Relative increases in LDD frequency tend to be higher for heavy-seeded plants, whereas absolute increases in LDD and spread rates are higher for light-seeded plants for which wind is often an important dispersal vector. While these predicted increases are not sufficient to compensate forecasted range losses and environmental changes can alter plant spread in various ways, our results generally suggest that warming can promote wind-driven movements of plant genotypes and populations in boreal forests.},

We modified this framework to generate predictions for species richness dynamics of fragmented plant communities and tested them in experimental landscapes across a 7-year time series. We found that two external factors, dispersal vectors and habitat features, affected species colonization and recolonization in habitat fragments and their effects varied and depended on motion capacity. Bird-dispersed species richness showed connectivity effects that reached an asymptote over time, but no edge effects, whereas wind-dispersed species richness showed steadily accumulating edge and connectivity effects, with no indication of an asymptote. Unassisted species also showed increasing differences caused by connectivity over time, whereas edges had no effect. Our limited use of proxies for movement ecology (e.g., dispersal mode as a proxy for motion capacity) resulted in moderate predictive power for communities and, in some cases, highlighted the importance of a more complete understanding of movement ecology for predicting how landscape conservation actions affect plant community dynamics.},

However, difficulties associated with inference from time-series data about unknown parameters in these models have been a constraint on their application. We present a new method that makes maximum likelihood estimation feasible for partially-observed nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems (also known as state-space models) where this was not previously the case. The method is based on a sequence of filtering operations which are shown to converge to a maximum likelihood parameter estimate. We make use of recent advances in nonlinear filtering in the implementation of the algorithm. We apply the method to the study of cholera in Bangladesh. We construct confidence intervals, perform residual analysis, and apply other diagnostics. Our analysis, based upon a model capturing the intrinsic nonlinear dynamics of the system, reveals some effects overlooked by previous studies.},

  abstract = {Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are a significant burden on global economies and public health. Their emergence is thought to be driven largely by socio-economic, environmental and ecological factors, but no comparative study has explicitly analysed these linkages to understand global temporal and spatial patterns of EIDs. Here we analyse a database of 335 EID 'events' (origins of EIDs) between 1940 and 2004, and demonstrate non-random global patterns. EID events have risen significantly over time after controlling for reporting bias, with their peak incidence (in the 1980s) concomitant with the HIV pandemic. EID events are dominated by zoonoses (60.3\% of EIDs): the majority of these (71.8\%) originate in wildlife (for example, severe acute respiratory virus, Ebola virus), and are increasing significantly over time. We find that 54.3\% of EID events are caused by bacteria or rickettsia, reflecting a large number of drug-resistant microbes in our database. Our results confirm that EID origins are significantly correlated with socio-economic, environmental and ecological factors, and provide a basis for identifying regions where new EIDs are most likely to originate (emerging disease 'hotspots'). They also reveal a substantial risk of wildlife zoonotic and vector-borne EIDs originating at lower latitudes where reporting effort is low. We conclude that global resources to counter disease emergence are poorly allocated, with the majority of the scientific and surveillance effort focused on countries from where the next important EID is least likely to originate.},

  abstract = {Knowledge on how landscape heterogeneity shapes host-parasite interactions is central to understand the emergence, dynamics and evolution of infectious diseases. However, this is an underexplored subject, particularly for plant-virus systems. Here, we analyse how landscape heterogeneity influences the prevalence, spatial genetic structure, and temporal dynamics of Pepper golden mosaic and Pepper huasteco yellow vein begomoviruses infecting populations of the wild pepper Capsicum annuum glabriusculum (chiltepin) in Mexico. Environmental heterogeneity occurred at different nested spatial scales (host populations within biogeographical provinces), with levels of human management varying among host population within a province. Results indicate that landscape heterogeneity affects the epidemiology and genetic structure of chiltepin-infecting begomoviruses in a scale-specific manner, probably related to conditions favouring the viruses' whitefly vector and its dispersion. Increased levels of human management of the host populations were associated with higher virus prevalence and erased the spatial genetic structure of the virus populations. Also, environmental heterogeneity similarly shaped the spatial genetic structures of host and viruses. This resulted in the congruence between host and virus phylogenies, which does not seem to be due to host-virus co-evolution. Thus, results provide evidence of the key role of landscape heterogeneity in determining plant-virus interactions.},

As a result, a hierarchy of informative disease and confidence maps can be produced, without the need to first try to identify a single appropriate scale of analysis.

  abstract = {Chagas disease incidence has sharply declined over the last decade. Long-term disease control will, however, require extensive, longitudinal surveillance systems capable of detecting (and dealing with) reinvasion-reinfestation of insecticide-treated dwellings by non-domiciliated triatomines. Sound surveillance design calls for reliable data on vector ecology, and these data must cover different spatial scales. We conducted a multi-scale assessment of ecological and evolutionary trends in members of the tribe Rhodniini, including (i) a macroscale analysis of Rhodniini species richness and composition patterns across the Americas, and (ii) a detailed, mesoscale case-study of ecological and behavioural trends in Rhodnius neglectus and R. nasutus. Our macroscale overview provides some comprehensive insights about key mechanisms/processes probably underlying ecological and genetic diversification in the Rhodniini. These insights translate into a series of testable hypotheses about current species distributions and their likely causes. At the landscape scale, we used geometric morphometrics to identify dubious specimens as either R. neglectus or R. nasutus (two near-sibling species), and studied palm tree populations of these two vector taxa in five geographical areas. The data suggest that deforestation and the associated loss of habitat and host diversity might increase the frequency of vector-human contact (and perhaps Trypanosoma cruzi infection rates in vectors). Surveillance in central-northeastern Brazil should prioritise deforested landscapes where large palm trees (e.g., Attalea, Mauritia, Copernicia, Acrocomia or Syagrus) occur near houses. We anticipate that, by helping define the distribution patterns and ecological preferences of each species, multi-scale research will significantly strengthen vector surveillance systems across Latin America.},

  abstract = {The role of global climate change in the decline of biodiversity and the emergence of infectious diseases remains controversial, and the effect of climatic variability, in particular, has largely been ignored. For instance, it was recently revealed that the proposed link between climate change and widespread amphibian declines, putatively caused by the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), was tenuous because it was based on a temporally confounded correlation. Here we provide temporally unconfounded evidence that global El Ni\~no climatic events drive widespread amphibian losses in genus Atelopus via increased regional temperature variability, which can reduce amphibian defenses against pathogens. Of 26 climate variables tested, only factors associated with temperature variability could account for the spatiotemporal patterns of declines thought to be associated with Bd. Climatic predictors of declines became significant only after controlling for a pattern consistent with epidemic spread (by temporally detrending the data). This presumed spread accounted for 59\% of the temporal variation in amphibian losses, whereas El Ni\~no accounted for 59\% of the remaining variation. Hence, we could account for 83\% of the variation in declines with these two variables alone. Given that global climate change seems to increase temperature variability, extreme climatic events, and the strength of Central Pacific El Ni\~no episodes, climate change might exacerbate worldwide enigmatic declines of amphibians, presumably by increasing susceptibility to disease. These results suggest that changes to temperature variability associated with climate change might be as significant to biodiversity losses and disease emergence as changes to mean temperature.},

  abstract = {Networks are ubiquitous in natural, technological and social systems. They are of increasing relevance for improved understanding and control of infectious diseases of plants, animals and humans, given the interconnectedness of today's world. Recent modelling work on disease development in complex networks shows: the relative rapidity of pathogen spread in scale-free compared with random networks, unless there is high local clustering; the theoretical absence of an epidemic threshold in scale-free networks of infinite size, which implies that diseases with low infection rates can spread in them, but the emergence of a threshold when realistic features are added to networks (e.g. finite size, household structure or deactivation of links); and the influence on epidemic dynamics of asymmetrical interactions. Models suggest that control of pathogens spreading in scale-free networks should focus on highly connected individuals rather than on mass random immunization. A growing number of empirical applications of network theory in human medicine and animal disease ecology confirm the potential of the approach, and suggest that network thinking could also benefit plant epidemiology and forest pathology, particularly in human-modified pathosystems linked by commercial transport of plant and disease propagules. Potential consequences for the study and management of plant and tree diseases are discussed.},

Some recent methodological and technological progress provides new and powerful tools to describe and analyse the spatial patterns of host-pathogen interactions. Here, we review some important topics in plant pathology that may benefit from a landscape perspective.

  abstract = {When one considers the fine-scale spread of an epidemic, one usually knows the sources of biological variability and their qualitative effect on the epidemic process. The force of infection on a susceptible unit depends on the locations and the strengths of the infectious units, and on the environmental and intrinsic factors affecting infectivity and/or susceptibility. The infection probability for the susceptible unit can then be modelled as a function of these factors. Thus, one can build a conceptual model at the fine scale. However, the epidemic is generally observed at a larger scale and one has to build a model adapted to this larger scale. But how can the sources of variation identified at the fine scale be integrated into the model at the larger scale? To answer this question, we present, in the context of plant epidemiology, a multi-scale approach which consists of defining a base model built at the fine scale and upscaling it to match the scale of the sampling and the data. This approach will enable comparing experiments involving different observational processes.},

We developed a spatially explicit model of European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus) dynamics that incorporates beetle phenology and forest susceptibility and integrated it in a climate-sensitive landscape model (LandClim). We first corroborated model outputs at various spatial and temporal scales and then applied the model in three case studies (in the Black Forest, Germany, and Davos, Switzerland) that cover an extended climatic gradient.

  abstract = {A predictive understanding of the ecological impacts of nonnative species has been slow to develop, owing largely to an apparent dearth of clearly defined hypotheses and the lack of a broad theoretical framework. The context dependency of impact has fueled the perception that meaningful generalizations are nonexistent. Here, we identified and reviewed 19 testable hypotheses that explain temporal and spatial variation in impact. Despite poor validation of most hypotheses to date, evidence suggests that each can explain at least some impacts in some situations. Several hypotheses are broad in scope (applying to plants and animals in virtually all contexts) and some of them, intriguingly, link processes of colonization and impact. Collectively, these hypotheses highlight the importance of the functional ecology of the nonnative species and the structure, diversity, and evolutionary experience of the recipient community as general determinants of impact; thus, they could provide the foundation for a theoretical framework for understanding and predicting impact. Further substantive progress toward this goal requires explicit consideration of within-taxon and across-taxa variation in the per capita effect of invaders, and analyses of complex interactions between invaders and their biotic and abiotic environments.},

The expected climate feedbacks of regional-scale mortality events have intensified the need to improve the simple mortality algorithms used for future predictions, but uncertainty regarding mortality processes precludes mechanistic modeling. By integrating new evidence from a wide range of fields, we conclude that hydraulic function and carbohydrate and defense metabolism have numerous potential failure points, and that these processes are strongly interdependent, both with each other and with destructive pathogen and insect populations. Crucially, most of these mechanisms and their interdependencies are likely to become amplified under a warmer, drier climate. Here, we outline the observations and experiments needed to test this interdependence and to improve simulations of this emergent global phenomenon.},

  volume = {23},
  issn = {1051-0761},
  abstract = {Consequences of bark beetle outbreaks for forest wildfire potential are receiving heightened attention, but little research has considered ecosystems with mixed-severity fire regimes. Such forests are widespread, variable in stand structure, and often fuel limited, suggesting that beetle outbreaks could substantially alter fire potentials. We studied canopy and surface fuels in interior Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii v. glauca) forests in Greater Yellowstone, Wyoming, USA, to determine how fuel characteristics varied with time since outbreak of the Douglas-fir beetle (Dendroctonus pseudotsugae). We sampled five stands in each of four outbreak stages, validated for pre-outbreak similarity: green (undisturbed), red (1-3 yr), gray (4-14 yr), and silver (25-30 yr). General linear models were used to compare variation in fuel profiles associated with outbreak to variation associated with the range of stand structures (dense mesic forest to open xeric parkland) characteristic of interior Douglas-fir forest. Beetle outbreak killed 38-83\% of basal area within stands, generating a mix of live trees and snags over several years. Canopy fuel load and bulk density began declining in the red stage via needle drop and decreased by approximately 50\% by the silver stage. The dead portion of available canopy fuels peaked in the red stage at 41\%. After accounting for background variation, there was little effect of beetle outbreak on surface fuels, with differences mainly in herbaceous biomass (50\% greater in red stands) and coarse woody fuels (doubled in silver stands). Within-stand spatial heterogeneity of fuels increased with time since outbreak, and surface-to-crown continuity decreased and remained low because of slow/sparse regeneration. Collectively, results suggest reduced fire potentials in post-outbreak stands, particularly for crown fire after the red stage, although abundant coarse fuels in silver stands may increase burn residence time and heat release. Outbreak effects on fuels were comparable to background variation in stand structure. The net effect of beetle outbreak was to shift the structure of mnsic closed-canopy stands toward that of parklands, and to shift xeric parklands toward very sparse woodlands. This study highlights the importance of evaluating outbreak effects in the context of the wide structural variation inherent to many forest types in the absence of beetle disturbance.},

We tested this hypothesis using data on primates and their parasites. First, we tested for relationships between species' resilience to human disturbance and their parasite richness, prevalence and immune defences, but found no associations. We then conducted a meta-analysis of the effects of disturbance on parasite prevalence, which revealed no overall effect, but a positive effect for one of four types of parasites (indirectly transmitted parasites). Finally, we conducted intraspecific analyses of malaria prevalence as a function of mammalian species richness in chimpanzees and gorillas, and an interspecific analysis of geographic overlap and parasite species richness, finding that higher levels of host richness favoured greater parasite risk. These results suggest that anthropogenic effects on disease transmission are complex, and highlight the need to define the conditions under which environmental change will increase or decrease disease transmission.},

  abstract = {Disease dynamics hinge on parasite transmission among hosts. However, canonical models for transmission often fit data poorly, limiting predictive ability. One solution involves building mechanistic yet general links between host behaviour and disease spread. To illustrate, we focus on the exposure component of transmission for hosts that consume their parasites, combining experiments, models and field data. Models of transmission that incorporate parasite consumption and foraging interference among hosts vastly outperformed alternatives when fit to experimental data using a zooplankton host (Daphnia dentifera) that consumes spores of a fungus (Metschnikowia bicuspidata). Once plugged into a fully dynamic model, both mechanisms inhibited epidemics overall. Foraging interference further depressed parasite invasion and prevalence at high host density, creating unimodal (hump-shaped) relationships between host density and these indices. These novel results qualitatively matched a unimodal density-prevalence relationship in natural epidemics. Ultimately, a mechanistic approach to transmission can reveal new insights into disease outbreaks.},

  abstract = {Given the importance of knowledge of species distribution for conservation and climate change management, continuous and progressive evaluation of the statistical models predicting species distributions is necessary. Current models are evaluated in terms of ecological theory used, the data model accepted and the statistical methods applied. Focus is restricted to Generalised Linear Models (GLM) and Generalised Additive Models (GAM). Certain currently unused regression methods are reviewed for their possible application to species modelling. A review of recent papers suggests that ecological theory is rarely explicitly considered. Current theory and results support species responses to environmental variables to be unimodal and often skewed though process-based theory is often lacking. Many studies fail to test for unimodal or skewed responses and straight-line relationships are often fitted without justification. Data resolution (size of sampling unit) determines the nature of the environmental niche models that can be fitted. A synthesis of differing ecophysiological ideas and the use of biophysical processes models could improve the selection of predictor variables. A better conceptual framework is needed for selecting variables. Comparison of statistical methods is difficult. Predictive success is insufficient and a test of ecological realism is also needed. Evaluation of methods needs artificial data, as there is no knowledge about the true relationships between variables for field data. However, use of artificial data is limited by lack of comprehensive theory. Three potentially new methods are reviewed. Quantile regression (QR) has potential and a strong theoretical justification in Liebig's law of the minimum. Structural equation modelling (SEM) has an appealing conceptual framework for testing causality but has problems with curvilinear relationships. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) intended to examine spatial non-stationarity of ecological processes requires further evaluation before being used. Synthesis and applications: explicit theory needs to be incorporated into species response models used in conservation. For example, testing for unimodal skewed responses should be a routine procedure. Clear statements of the ecological theory used, the nature of the data model and sufficient details of the statistical method are needed for current models to be evaluated. New statistical methods need to be evaluated for compatibility with ecological theory before use in applied ecology. Some recent work with artificial data suggests the combination of ecological knowledge and statistical skill is more important than the precise statistical method used. The potential exists for a synthesis of current species modelling approaches based on their differing ecological insights not their methodology. Crown Copyright ?? 2006.},

  abstract = {1. While teaching statistics to ecologists, the lead authors of this paper have noticed common statistical problems. If a random sample of their work (including scientific papers) produced before doing these courses were selected, half would probably contain violations of the underlying assumptions of the statistical techniques employed. 2. Some violations have little impact on the results or ecological conclusions; yet others increase type I or type II errors, potentially resulting in wrong ecological conclusions. Most of these violations can be avoided by applying better data exploration. These problems are especially troublesome in applied ecology, where management and policy decisions are often at stake. 3. Here, we provide a protocol for data exploration; discuss current tools to detect outliers, heterogeneity of variance, collinearity, dependence of observations, problems with interactions, double zeros in multivariate analysis, zero inflation in generalized linear modelling, and the correct type of relationships between dependent and independent variables; and provide advice on how to address these problems when they arise. We also address misconceptions about normality, and provide advice on data transformations. 4. Data exploration avoids type I and type II errors, among other problems, thereby reducing the chance of making wrong ecological conclusions and poor recommendations. It is therefore essential for good quality management and policy based on statistical analyses.},

  abstract = {Projected increases in wildfire and other climate-driven disturbances will affect populations and communities worldwide, including host-parasite relationships. Research in temperate forests has shown that wildfire can negatively affect amphibians, but this research has occurred primarily outside of managed landscapes where interactions with human disturbances could result in additive or synergistic effects. Furthermore, parasites represent a large component of biodiversity and can affect host fitness and population dynamics, yet they are rarely included in studies of how vertebrate hosts respond to disturbance. To determine how wildfire affects amphibians and their parasites, and whether effects differ between protected and managed landscapes, we compared abundance of two amphibians and two nematodes relative to wildfire extent and severity around wetlands in neighboring protected and managed forests (Montana, USA). Population sizes of adult, male long-toed salamanders (Ambystoma macrodactylum) decreased with increased burn severity, with stronger negative effects on isolated populations and in managed forests. In contrast, breeding population sizes of Columbia spotted frogs (Rana luteiventris) increased with burn extent in both protected and managed protected forests. Path analysis showed that the effects of wildfire on the two species of nematodes were consistent with differences in their life history and transmission strategies and the responses of their hosts. Burn severity indirectly reduced abundance of soil-transmitted Cosmocercoides variabilis through reductions in salamander abundance. Burn severity also directly reduced C. variabilis abundance, possibly though changes in soil conditions. For the aquatically transmitted nematode Gyrinicola batrachiensis, the positive effect of burn extent on density of Columbia spotted frog larvae indirectly increased parasite abundance. Our results show that effects of wildfire on amphibians depend upon burn extent and severity, isolation, and prior land use. Through subsequent effects on the parasites, our results also reveal how changes in disturbance regimes can affect communities across trophic levels.},

  doi = {10.1890/11-2224.1},
  abstract = {Wildlife managers often use habitat models to determine species habitat requirements and to identify locations for conservation efforts, uses which depend on accurate specification of species-habitat relationships. Prior study suggests that model performance may be influenced by the way we measure environmental predictors. We hypothesized that species responses to landscape predictors are best represented by landscape composition-based measurements, rather than distance-based measurements. We also hypothesized that models using empirical data to select an appropriate scale of effect for each habitat predictor (multi-scale models) should perform better than models that assume a common scale of effect for all predictors (single-scale models). To test these hypotheses we constructed habitat models for three mammal species, Mephitis mephitis, Mustela erminea, and Procyon lotor, based on surveys conducted in 80 landscapes in southeastern Ontario, Canada. For each species we compared the performance of distance- and composition-based measurements, and we compared the performance of single- and multi-scale models. The composition-based measurement, measured at its empirically determined scale of effect, had greater explanatory power than the distance-based measurement of a given predictor more often than expected by chance, supporting our first hypothesis. Contrary to expectation, multi-scale models did not have better explanatory power or predictive performance relative to single-scale models. We identified and evaluated four potential mechanisms to explain this, and, depending on the species, we found that the best explanation was either that predictors have significant effects at a common scale or that, although the modeled effects were at multiple scales, they were of similar magnitude and direction at the scales modeled in single- and multi-scale models. Our results suggest that habitat modeling based on distance-based measurements could be improved by including composition-based measurements of landscape predictor variables, but that inclusion of predictor-specific scales of effect for composition-based measurements does not necessarily improve performance over models including composition-based measurements at a single scale. Conservation and wildlife management may be simplified when single-scale models perform as well as multi-scale models, as this suggests actions conducted at a single scale may address management objectives as well as actions taken at different scales for different landscape features.},

  abstract = {Climate change is expected to alter the dynamics of infectious diseases around the globe. Predictive models remain elusive due to the complexity of host\textendash{}parasite systems and insufficient data describing how environ- mental conditions affect various system components. Here, we link host\textendash{}macroparasite models with the Metabolic Theory of Ecology, providing a mechanistic framework that allows integrating multiple nonlinear environmental effects to estimate parasite fitness under novel conditions. The models allow determining the fundamental thermal niche of a parasite, and thus, whether climate change leads to range contraction or may permit a range expansion. Applying the models to seasonal environments, and using an arctic nematode with an endotherm host for illustration, we show that climate warming can split a continuous spring-to-fall transmission season into two separate transmission seasons with altered timings. Although the models are strategic and most suitable to evaluate broad-scale patterns of climate change impacts, close correspondence between model predictions and empirical data indicates model applicability also at the species level. As the application of Metabolic Theory considerably aids the a priori estimation of model para- meters, even in data-sparse systems, we suggest that the presented approach could provide a framework for understanding and predicting climatic impacts for many host\textendash{}parasite systems worldwide.},

We describe three important components for determining optimal invasion management: invasion dynamics, costs of control efforts and a monetary measure of invasion damages. We find that a management objective that explicitly considers both costs and damages is most appropriate for determining economically optimal strategies, but also leads to large challenges due to uncertainty in components of the management problem. To address uncertainty, some studies have included stochasticity in their models; others have quantified the value of information or focused on decision-making with limited information. Our synthesis shows how invasion characteristics, such as costs, damages, pattern of spread and invasion and landscape size, affect optimal control strategies and goals in systematic ways. We find that even for simple questions, such as whether control should be applied at the centre of an invasion or to satellite patches, the answer depends on the details of a particular invasion. Future work should seek to better quantify key components of this problem, determine best management in the face of limited information, improve understanding of spatial aspects of invasion control and design approaches to improve the feasibility of achieving regional control goals.},

  abstract = {The current mountain pine beetle (MPB; Dendroctonus ponderosae) outbreak in the southern Rocky Mountains has impacted approximately 750 000 ha of forest. Weather and habitat heterogeneity influence forest insect population dynamics at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Comparison of forest insect population dynamics in two principal host species may elucidate the relative contribution of weather and landscape factors in initiating and driving extensive outbreaks. To investigate potential drivers of the current MPB outbreak, we compared broadscale spatiotemporal patterns of MPB activity in lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) from 1996 to 2010 in Colorado and southern Wyoming with regional weather fluctuations, and then tracked the annual meso-scale progression of the epidemic in lodgepole pine with respect to weather, topographic, previous MPB activity, and forest stand attributes. MPB activity in lodgepole pine compared to ponderosa pine showed higher magnitude and extent of spatial synchrony. Warm temperatures and low annual precipitation favorable to beetle populations showed high regional synchrony across areas of both pine species, suggesting that habitat interacts with weather in synchronizing MPB populations. Cluster analysis of time series patterns identified multiple, disjunct locations of incipient MPB activity (epicenters) in lodgepole pine, which overlapped an earlier 1980s MPB outbreak, and suggests a regional trigger (drought) across this homogenous forest type. Negative departures from mean annual precipitation played a key role in subsequent spread of MPB outbreak. Development of the outbreak was also associated with lower elevations, greater dominance by lodgepole pine, stands of larger tree size, and stands with higher percentage canopy cover. After epidemic levels of MPB activity were attained, MPB activity was less strongly associated with stand and weather variables. These results emphasize the importance of considering differences in patterns of MPB dynamics for different host pine species even under similar regional-scale weather variation and the nonstationarity of outbreak dynamics over time.},

  abstract = {Widespread outbreaks of mountain pine beetle in North America have drawn the attention of scientists, forest managers, and the public. There is strong evidence that climate change has contributed to the extent and severity of recent outbreaks. Scientists are interested in quantifying relationships between bark beetle population dynamics and trends in climate. Process models that simulate climate suitability for mountain pine beetle outbreaks have advanced our understanding of beetle population dynamics; however, there are few studies that have assessed their accuracy across multiple outbreaks or at larger spatial scales. This study used the observed number of trees killed by mountain pine beetles per square kilometer in Oregon and Washington, USA, over the past three decades to quantify and assess the influence of climate and weather variables on beetle activity over longer time periods and larger scales than previously studied. Influences of temperature and precipitation in addition to process model output variables were assessed at annual and climatological time scales. The statistical analysis showed that new attacks are more likely to occur at locations with climatological mean August temperatures 15 degrees C. After controlling for beetle pressure, the variables with the largest effect on the odds of an outbreak exceeding a certain size were minimum winter temperature (positive relationship) and drought conditions in current and previous years. Precipitation levels in the year prior to the outbreak had a positive effect, possibly an indication of the influence of this driver on brood size. Two-year cumulative precipitation had a negative effect, a possible indication of the influence of drought on tree stress. Among the process model variables, cold tolerance was the strongest indicator of an outbreak increasing to epidemic size. A weather suitability index developed from the regression analysis indicated a 2.5x increase in the odds of outbreak at locations with highly suitable weather vs. locations with low suitability. The models were useful for estimating expected amounts of damage (total area with outbreaks) and for quantifying the contribution of climate to total damage. Overall, the results confirm the importance of climate and weather on the spatial expansion of bark beetle outbreaks over time.},

  abstract = {The transmission of infectious diseases is an inherently ecological process involving interactions among at least two, and often many, species. Not surprisingly, then, the species diversity of ecological communities can potentially affect the prevalence of infectious diseases. Although a number of studies have now identified effects of diversity on disease prevalence, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear in many cases. Starting with simple epidemiological models, we describe a suite of mechanisms through which diversity could increase or decrease disease risk, and illustrate the potential applicability of these mechanisms for both vector-borne and non-vector-borne diseases, and for both specialist and generalist pathogens. We review examples of how these mechanisms may operate in specific disease systems. Because the effects of diversity on multi-host disease systems have been the subject of much recent research and controversy, we describe several recent efforts to delineate under what general conditions host diversity should increase or decrease disease prevalence, and illustrate these with examples. Both models and literature reviews suggest that high host diversity is more likely to decrease than increase disease risk. Reduced disease risk with increasing host diversity is especially likely when pathogen transmission is frequency-dependent, and when pathogen transmission is greater within species than between species, particularly when the most competent hosts are also relatively abundant and widespread. We conclude by identifying focal areas for future research, including (1) describing patterns of change in disease risk with changing diversity; (2) identifying the mechanisms responsible for observed changes in risk; (3) clarifying additional mechanisms in a wider range of epidemiological models; and (4) experimentally manipulating disease systems to assess the impact of proposed mechanisms.},

The aim is to achieve the estimation of direct, indirect, and total effects of one variable on another and to assess the adequacy of whole models. Path analytical techniques based on maximum likelihood currently used in ecology are rarely adequate for ecological data, which are often sparse, multi-level, and may contain nonlinear relationships as well as nonnormal response data such as counts or proportion data. Here I introduce a more flexible approach in the form of the joint application of hierarchical Bayes, Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms, Shipley's d-sep test, and the potential outcomes framework to fit path models as well as to decompose and estimate effects. An example based on the direct and indirect interactions between ants, two insect herbivores, and a plant species demonstrates the implementation of these techniques, using freely available software.},

  abstract = {Neglect of ecological knowledge is a limiting factor in the use of statistical modelling to predict species distribution. Three components are needed for statistical modelling, an ecological model concerning the ecological theory to be used or tested, a data model concerning the collection and measurement of the data, and a statistical model concerning the statistical theory and methods used. This component framework is reviewed with emphasis on ecological theory. The expected shape of a species response curve to an environmental gradient is a central assumption on which agreement has yet to be reached. The nature of the environmental predictors whether indirect variables, e.g. latitude that have no physiological impact on plants, or direct variables, e.g. temperature also influence the type of response expected. Straight-line relationships between organisms and environment are often used uncritically. Many users of canonical correlation analysis use linear (straight-line) functions to relate ordination axes to variables such as slope and aspect though this is not a necessary part of the method. Some statisticians have used straight lines for species/environment relationships without testing, when evaluating new statistical procedures. Assumptions used in one component often conflict with those in another component. Statistical models can be used to explore ecological theory. Skewed species response curves predominate contrary to the symmetric unimodal curves assumed by some statistical methods. Improvements in statistical modelling can be achieved based on ecological concepts. Examples include incorporating interspecific competition from dominant species; more proximal predictors based on water balance models and spatial autocorrelation procedures to accommodate non-equilibrium vegetation.},

  abstract = {In a constantly changing environment, monitoring supports analysis and understanding of many types of change. This paper is concerned specifically with monitoring of vegetation and describes the development and application of a formal model that supports the analysis of spatiotemporal changes in the recorded attributes of a forest/heathland environment. Typically, the monitoring points are not ideally distributed in time or space. The proposed analytical techniques are designed to deal with incomplete data sets and to reveal abnormal changes or transitions. These transitions can potentially be linked to causal events which may have not been otherwise recorded. This work distinguishes five key change types as a basis for 25 transition types present in time series of vegetation data. These are distilled from the data using a set of transition point analysis methods including spatiotemporal neighborhood and trend sequence analysis. In addition, cross-comparisons between vegetation attributes, based on the identified transitions, are illustrated. A prototype GIS-based tool VeMonA provides an analytical environment for time series data obtained through vegetation monitoring and supports understanding of dynamic geospatial ecosystems. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

  volume = {22},
  issn = {1051-0761},
  abstract = {Range expansion by native and exotic species will continue to be a major component of global change. Anticipating the potential effects of changes in species distributions requires models capable of forecasting population spread across realistic, heterogeneous landscapes and subject to spatiotemporal variability in habitat suitability. Several decades of theory and model development, as well as increased computing power and availability of fine-resolution GIS data, now make such models possible. Still unanswered, however, is the question of how well this new generation of dynamic models will anticipate range expansion. Here we develop a spatially explicit stochastic model that combines dynamic dispersal and population processes with fine-resolution maps characterizing spatiotemporal heterogeneity in climate and habitat to model range expansion of the hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA; Adelges tsugae). We parameterize this model using multiyear data sets describing population and dispersal dynamics of HWA and apply it to eastern North America over a 57-year period (1951-2008). To evaluate the model, the observed pattern of spread of HWA during this same period was compared to model predictions. Our model predicts considerable heterogeneity in the risk of HWA invasion across space and through time, and it suggests that spatiotemporal variation in winter temperature, rather than hemlock abundance, exerts a primary control on the spread of HWA. Although the simulations generally matched the observed current extent of the invasion of HWA and patterns of anisotropic spread, it did not correctly predict when HWA was observed to arrive in different geographic regions. We attribute differences between the modeled and observed dynamics to an inability to capture the timing and direction of long-distance dispersal events that substantially affected the ensuing pattern of spread.},

  abstract = {One unexpected consequence of natural disturbances in forested areas is that managers often initiate activities that may impose greater ecosystem impacts than the disturbances themselves. By salvage logging areas affected by windstorms or other impacts, by harvesting host trees in advance of insect infestation or disease, or by preemptively harvesting forests in an attempt to improve their resilience to future disturbances and stresses, managers initiate substantial changes in the ecosystem structure and function. Much of this activity is undertaken in the absence of information on the qualitative and quantitative differences between disturbance impacts and harvesting. To provide insight for such decisions we evaluated the ecosystem consequences of two major disturbance processes in New England (U.S.A.)-intense windstorms and invasive pests and pathogens-and contrasted them with impacts from preemptive and salvage harvesting, Despite dramatic physical changes in forest structure resulting from hurricane impacts and insect infestation, little disruption of biogeochemical processes or other ecosystem functions typically follows these disturbances. Indeed, the physical and organic structures produced by these disturbances are important natural features providing habitat and landscape heterogeneity that are often missing due to centuries of land use. From an ecosystem perspective there are strong arguments against preemptive and salvage logging or the attempt through silvicultural means to improve the resistance or resilience of forests to disturbance and stress. There are often valid motivations for salvage or preemptive logging including financial considerations, human safety, and a desire to shape the long-term composition and resource-production characteristics of forests. Nonetheless, there are many ecological benefits derived from leaving forests alone when they are affected or threatened by disturbances and pest and pathogen outbreaks.},

  abstract = {Disturbance regimes are changing rapidly, and the consequences of such changes for ecosystems and linked social-ecological systems will be profound. This paper synthesizes current understanding of disturbance with an emphasis on fundamental contributions to contemporary landscape and ecosystem ecology, then identifies future research priorities. Studies of disturbance led to insights about heterogeneity, scale, and thresholds in space and time and catalyzed new paradigms in ecology. Because they create vegetation patterns, disturbances also establish spatial patterns of many ecosystem processes on the landscape. Drivers of global change will produce new spatial patterns, altered disturbance regimes, novel trajectories of change, and surprises. Future disturbances will continue to provide valuable opportunities for studying pattern-process interactions. Changing disturbance regimes will produce acute changes in ecosystems and ecosystem services over the short (years to decades) and long term (centuries and beyond). Future research should address questions related to (1) disturbances as catalysts of rapid ecological change, (2) interactions among disturbances, (3) relationships between disturbance and society, especially the intersection of land use and disturbance, and (4) feedbacks from disturbance to other global drivers. Ecologists should make a renewed and concerted effort to understand and anticipate the causes and consequences of changing disturbance regimes.},

  volume = {30},
  abstract = {The effects of wildfire on wildlife are important considerations for resource managers because of recent interest in the role of fire in shaping forested landscapes in the western United States. This is particularly true of wildfire effects on spotted owls (Strix occidentalis) because of the uncertainty of impacts of controlled burning within spotted owl habitat. Therefore, we documented minimum survival, site fidelity, mate fidelity, and reproductive success for 21 spotted owls after large (540 ha) wildfires occurred within 11 owl territories in California, Arizona, and New Mexico. In each territory, fire burned through the nest and primary roost sites. Eighteen owls (86\%) were known to be alive at least 1 year after the fires, which was similar to reported annual adult survival probabilities for the species. Of 7 pairs of which both members were later resighted, all were located together on the same territories during the breeding season following fires, and 4 pairs produced a total of 7 fledglings. No pair separations were observed after fire. On 8 territories where fire severities were mapped, 50\% experienced predominantly low- to moderate-severity fires while 50\% experienced high-severity fires that burned large (30\%) areas of the territories. We hypothesize that wildfires may have little short-term impact on survival, site fidelity, mate fidelity, and reproductive success of spotted owls. Further, prescribed burning could be an effective tool in restoring habitat to natural conditions with minimal short-term impact on resident spotted owls. While we do not advocate wholesale prescribed burning in spotted owl territories at this time, we believe our observations justify large-scale experiments on effects of prescribed burning on spotted owls to corroborate our observations and to establish cause-and-effect relationships.},

  doi = {10.1890/10-1176.1},
  abstract = {Disturbance interactions have received growing interest in ecological research in the last decade. Fire and bark beetle outbreaks have recently increased in severity and extent across western North America, raising concerns about their possible interactions. Although it is often presumed that bark beetle outbreaks increase probability of active crown fire by producing high loads of surface and canopy dead fuels, empirical data are scarce and results are ambivalent. We combined field measurements and modeling to address the following question: How do fuel characteristics, microclimate, and potential fire behavior change with time since a severe mountain pine beetle outbreak in Pinus contorta forests of Greater Yellowstone (Wyoming, USA)? We measured surface and canopy fuels, and soil surface temperature in a time-since-beetle-outbreak chronosequence (n\textonequarter{}35 sites) from undisturbed to 36 years post-outbreak, including stands in red- and gray-needle stages (respectively, 1\textendash{}2 and 3\textendash{}5 years post-outbreak). Field data were used to parameterize the fire behavior model NEXUS and predict potential fire behavior at each site. Dead surface fuel loads of all size categories did not differ among undisturbed, red, and gray-stage stands. Compared to undisturbed sites, red and gray-stage sites had on average 53\% lower canopy bulk density, 42\% lower canopy fuel load, and 29\% lower canopy moisture content, but had similar canopy base heights (3.1 m). In subsequent decades, coarse wood loads doubled and canopy base height declined to 0 m. Modeling results suggested that undisturbed, red, and gray-stage stands were unlikely to exhibit transition of surface fires to tree crowns (torching), and that the likelihood of sustaining an active crown fire (crowning) decreased from undisturbed to gray-stage stands. Simulated fire behavior was little affected by beetle disturbance when wind speed was either below 40 km/h or above 60 km/h, but at intermediate wind speeds, probability of crowning in red- and gray-stage stands was lower than in undisturbed stands, and old post-outbreak stands were predicted to have passive crown fires. Results were consistent across a range of fuel moisture scenarios. Our results suggest that mountain pine beetle outbreaks in Greater Yellowstone may reduce the probability of active crown fire in the short term by thinning lodgepole pine canopies. Key},

  doi = {10.1016/j.foreco.2011.09.019},
  abstract = {On the dry, flat, jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.)-dominated ecosystems of the northern Lake States and eastern Canada, wildfire behavior often produces narrow, remnant strips of unburned trees that provide heterogeneity on a landscape historically shaped by stand-replacing wildfires. We used landscape metrics to analyze a chronosequence of aerial imagery to examine these " stringers" of mature trees within historical wildfires in northern Lower Michigan. Our major objective was to describe the natural range of variability of stringer patterns and their persistence and change during the fire-free interval. Field studies were then used to examine stringer composition and structural variability. Stringers were found to occur in all fires 1000. ha, in about one-third of wildfires 80. ha, but never in fires 80. ha, likely because of the lack of fire intensity on smaller fires that is necessary for stringers to be formed. Stringers were typically composed of many small, well-aggregated patches that represented 3-14\% of the area within the burn perimeter, and stringer formation was relatively independent of pre-fire forest structure or composition. Stringer patterns changed mostly in the first decade after the fire that created them and then stabilized. Major changes that occurred in stringer patterns after this period were most often due to human activities, highlighting their natural persistence through the fire-free interval. The historical persistence and importance of these features also highlights their importance on modern fire-prone landscapes, particularly in northern Lower Michigan where a high proportion of land management is focused on jack pine plantations for breeding habitat for Kirtland's warbler (Dendroica kirtlandii Baird), an endangered species. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Carriere forests. Location The study was conducted within an area extending from southern Connecticut up to and including the Connecticut River lowlands west to the Berkshire Plateau in central Massaschusetts, USA. Methods Overstorey and understorey vegetation and ecosystem function parameters such as decomposition and nitrogen cycling were examined in logged and unlogged portions of ten hemlock stands varying in HWA damage intensity. Results Intensive hemlock logging generated more rapid and pronounced microenvironment and vegetation changes than chronic HWA damage. Black birch (Betula lenta L.) seedling densities and percent cover of brambles (Rubus L. spp.), sedges (Carex L. spp.) and hay-scented fern (Dennstaedtia punctilobula Michx.) were significantly higher in recent harvests vs. HWA-damaged and undamaged sites. High black birch sapling densities (7000 ha-1 were common in the older harvests but not in adjacent, HWA-damaged portions of these sites. Undamaged sites had 20\% more forest floor mass than HWA-damaged sites and double the mass of older cuts. Mass loss rates of cellulose paper suggest that conditions were more favourable for decomposition in the damaged and older logged sites. Recently cut sites had significantly larger inorganic N pools than undamaged forests, although total net nitrogen (N) mineralization rates were not significantly different among treatments. Nitrification rates of 0.2 kg ha-1 day-1 measured in the oldest cuts were three times greater than in HWA-damaged sites and over 200 times greater than in undamaged hemlock sites.

  abstract = {Abstract The results of predictive vegetation models are often presented spatially as GIS-derived surfaces of vegetation attributes across a landscape or region, but spatial information is rarely included in the model itself. Geographically weighted regression (GWR), which extends the traditional regression framework by allowing regression coefficients to vary for individual locations (`spatial non-stationarity'), is one method of utilizing spatial information to improve the predictive power of such models. In this paper, we compare the ability of GWR, a local model, with that of ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression, a global model, to predict patterns of montane ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) basal area in Saguaro National Park, AZ, USA on the basis of variables related to topography (elevation, slope steepness, aspect) and fire history (fire frequency, time since fire). The localized regression coefficients exhibited significant non-stationarity for four of the five environmental variables, and the GWR model consequently described the vegetation-environment data significantly better, even after accounting for differences in model complexity. GWR also reduced observed spatial autocorrelation of the model residuals. When applied to independent data locations not used in model development, basal areas predicted by GWR had a closer fit to observed values with lower residuals than those from the optimal OLS regression model. GWR also provided insights into fine-scale controls of ponderosa pine pattern that were missed by the global model. For example, the relationship between ponderosa pine basal area and aspect, which was obscured in the OLS regression model due to non-stationarity, was clearly demonstrated by the GWR model. We thus see GWR as a valuable complement to the many other global methods currently in use for predictive vegetation modeling.},

Until recently, these topics were taught separately, modeling courses emphasizing mathematical techniques for symbolic analysis and statistics courses emphasizing procedures for analyzing data. We advocate the merger of these traditions in ecological education by outlining a curriculum for an introductory course in data-model assimilation. This course replaces the procedural emphasis of traditional introductory material in statistics with an emphasis on principles needed to develop hierarchical models of ecological systems, fusing models of data with models of ecological processes. We sketch nine elements of such a course: (1) models as routes to insight, (2) uncertainty, (3) basic probability theory, (4) hierarchical models, (5) data simulation, (6) likelihood and Bayes, (7) computational methods, (8) research design, and (9) problem solving. The outcome of teaching these combined elements can be the fundamental understanding and quantitative confidence needed by students to create revealing analyses for a broad array of research problems.},

  doi = {10.1890/ES11-00345.1},
  abstract = {Future disruptions to fire activity will threaten ecosystems and human well-being throughout the world, yet there are few fire projections at global scales and almost none from a broad range of global climate models (GCMs). Here we integrate global fire datasets and environmental covariates to build spatial statistical models of fire probability at a 0.58 resolution and examine environmental controls on fire activity. Fire models are driven by climate norms from 16 GCMs (A2 emissions scenario) to assess the magnitude and direction of change over two time periods, 2010\textendash{}2039 and 2070\textendash{}2099. From the ensemble results, we identify areas of consensus for increases or decreases in fire activity, as well as areas where GCMs disagree. Although certain biomes are sensitive to constraints on biomass productivity and others to atmospheric conditions promoting combustion, substantial and rapid shifts are projected for future fire activity across vast portions of the globe. In the near term, the most consistent increases in fire activity occur in biomes with already somewhat warm climates; decreases are less pronounced and concentrated primarily in a few tropical and subtropical biomes. However, models do not agree on the direction of near- term changes across more than 50\% of terrestrial lands, highlighting major uncertainties in the next few decades. By the end of the century, the magnitude and the agreement in direction of change are projected to increase substantially. Most far-term model agreement on increasing fire probabilities (;62\%) occurs at mid- to high-latitudes, while agreement on decreasing probabilities (;20\%) is mainly in the tropics. Although our global models demonstrate that long-term environmental norms are very successful at capturing chronic fire probability patterns, future work is necessary to assess how much more explanatory power would be added through interannual variation in climate variables. This study provides a first examination of global disruptions to fire activity using an empirically based statistical framework and a multi-model ensemble of GCM projections, an important step toward assessing fire-related vulnerabilities to humans and the ecosystems upon which they depend.

We apply this approach to study the incidence of eastern spruce dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium pusillum) in Minnesota black spruce (Picea mariana). A Minnesota Department of Natural Resources operational inventory of black spruce stands in northern Minnesota found mistletoe in 11\% of surveyed stands, while a small, specific-pest survey found mistletoe in 56\% of the surveyed stands. We reconcile these two surveys within a Bayesian hierarchical framework and predict that 35-59\% of black spruce stands in northern Minnesota are infested with dwarf mistletoe.},

  doi = {10.1890/09-1409.1},
  abstract = {Ecologists worldwide are challenged to contribute solutions to urgent and pressing environmental problems by forecasting how populations, communities, and ecosystems will respond to global change. Rising to this challenge requires organizing ecological information derived from diverse sources and formally assimilating data with models of ecological processes. The study of infectious disease has depended on strategies for integrating patterns of observed disease incidence with mechanistic process models since John Snow first mapped cholera cases around a London water pump in 1854. Still, zoonotic and vector-borne diseases increasingly affect human populations, and methods used to successfully characterize directly transmitted diseases are often insufficient. We use four case studies to demonstrate that advances in disease forecasting require better understanding of zoonotic host and vector populations, as well of the dynamics that facilitate pathogen amplification and disease spillover into humans. In each case study, this goal is complicated by limited data, spatiotemporal variability in pathogen transmission and impact, and often, insufficient biological understanding. We present a conceptual framework for data-model fusion in infectious disease research that addresses these fundamental challenges using a hierarchical state-space structure to (1) integrate multiple data sources and spatial scales to inform latent parameters, (2) partition uncertainty in process and observation models, and (3) explicitly build upon existing ecological and epidemiological understanding. Given the constraints inherent in the study of infectious disease and the urgent need for progress, fusion of data and expertise via this type of conceptual framework should prove an indispensable tool.},

  abstract = {In field experiments manipulating generalist pathogens and host community composition, the presence of a highly susceptible reservoir species drove disease dynamics in multiple nonreservoir species, sometimes decreasing their abundance through apparent competition. The dynamics of generalist pathogens in multispecies host communities remain a major frontier for disease ecology. Of particular interest are how host community structure controls pathogen transmission and how disease spread feeds back to influence the host community. Pathogen spillover occurs when epidemics in a host population are driven not by transmission within that population but by transmission from a reservoir population. Here we review examples of spillover in pathogens infecting humans, domesticated animals, and crops, noting that most empirical evidence for spillover results from nonmanipulative, observational studies. We then present results from two field experiments utilizing an experimentally tractable model system of annual wild grasses and a generalist virus, the barley yellow dwarf virus. In these experiments, the presence of a highly susceptible reservoir species, Avena fatua (wild oats), greatly increased pathogen prevalence in several other species. This result demonstrates pathogen spillover and illustrates the crucial role of host community structure in controlling the dynamics of generalist pathogens. Further, pathogen spillover from A. fatua decreased the abundance of two other host species through pathogen-mediated apparent competition. Thus, our results provide experimental support for theoretical predictions of strong feedbacks between host community structure and generalist disease dynamics.},

  abstract = {A decade after its creation, the Northwest Forest Plan is contributing to the conservation of old-growth forests on federal land. However the success and outlook for the plan are questionable in the dry provinces, where losses of old growth to wildfire have been relatively high and risks of further loss remain. We summarize the state of knowledge of old-growth forests in the plan area, identify challenges to conserve them, and suggest some conservation approaches that might better meet the goals of the plan. Historically, old-growth forests in these provinces ranged from open, patchy stands, maintained by frequent low-severity fire, to a mosaic of dense and open stands maintained by mixed-severity fires. Old-growth structure and composition were spatially heterogeneous, varied strongly with topography and elevation, and were shaped by a complex disturbance regime of fire, insects, and disease. With fire suppression and cutting of large pines (Pinus spp.) and Douglas-firs (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirbel] Franco), old-growth diversity has declined and dense understories have developed across large areas. Challenges to conserving these forests include a lack of definitions needed for planning of fire-dependent old-growth stands and landscapes, and conflicts in conservation goals that can be resolved only at the landscape level. Fire suppression has increased the area of the dense, older forest favored by Northern Spotted Owls (Strix occidentalis caurina) but increased the probability of high-severity fire. The plan allows for fuel reduction in late-successional reserves; fuel treatments, however apparently have not happened at a high enough rate or been applied in a landscape-level approach. Landscape-level strategies are needed that prioritize fuel treatments by vegetation zones, develop shaded fuel breaks in strategic positions, and thin and apply prescribed fire to reduce ladder fuels around remaining old trees. Evaluations of the current and alternative strategies are needed to determine whether the current reserve-matrix approach is the best strategy to meet plan goals in these dynamic landscapes.},

  abstract = {Infectious disease is listed among the top five causes of global species extinctions. However, the majority of available data supporting this contention is largely anecdotal. We used the IUCN Red List of Threatened and Endangered Species and literature indexed in the ISI Web of Science to assess the role of infectious disease in global species loss. Infectious disease was listed as a contributing factor in 4\% of species extinctions known to have occurred since 1500 (833 plants and animals) and as contributing to a species' status as critically endangered in 8\% of cases (2,852 critically endangered plants and animals). Although infectious diseases appear to play a minor role in global species loss, our findings underscore two important limitations in the available evidence: uncertainty surrounding the threats to species survival and a temporal bias in the data. Several initiatives could help overcome these obstacles, including rigorous scientific tests to determine which infectious diseases present a significant threat at the species level, recognition of the limitations associated with the lack of baseline data for the role of infectious disease in species extinctions, combining data with theory to discern the circumstances under which infectious disease is most likely to serve as an agent of extinction, and improving surveillance programs for the detection of infectious disease. An evidence-based understanding of the role of infectious disease in species extinction and endangerment will help prioritize conservation initiatives and protect global biodiversity.},

  doi = {10.1890/11-1680.1},
  abstract = {To maintain healthy ecosystems, natural-disturbance-based management aims to minimize differences between unmanaged and managed landscapes. Two related approaches may help accomplish this goal, either applied together or in isolation: (1) concentrating anthropogenic disturbance through zoning (with protected areas and intensive management); and (2) emulating natural disturbances. The purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of these two approaches, applied both in isolation and in combination, on the structure of the forest landscape. To do so, we use a spatially explicit landscape simulation model on a large fire-dominated landscape in eastern Canada. Specifically, we examine the effects of (1) increasing the maximum size of logged stands (cutblocks) to better emulate the full range of fire sizes in a fire-dominated landscape, (2) increasing protected areas, and (3) adding aggregated or dispersed intensive wood production areas to the landscape in addition to protected areas (triad management). We focus on maximizing the amount and minimizing the fragmentation of old-growth forest and on reducing road construction. Increasing maximum cutblock size and adding protected areas led to reduced road construction, while the latter also resulted in less fragmentation and more old growth. Although protected areas led to reduced harvest volume, the addition of an intensive production zone (triad management) counterbalanced this loss and resulted in more old growth than equivalent scenarios with protected areas but no intensive production zone. However, we found no differences between aggregated and dispersed intensive wood production. Our results imply that differences between unmanaged and managed landscapes can be reduced by concentrating logging efforts through a combination of protected areas and intensive wood production, and by creating some larger cutblocks. We conclude that the forest industry and regulators should therefore seek to increase protected areas through triad management and consider increasing maximum cutblock size. These results add to a growing body of literature indicating that intensive management on a small part of the landscape may be better than less intensive management spread out over a much larger part of the landscape, whether this is in the context of forestry, agriculture, or urban development.},

Three nests were located in mixed-conifer forests, 2 in areas of moderate-severity burn, and one in an area of low-severity burn, and one nest was located in an unburned area of mixed-conifer-hardwood forest. For roosting during the breeding season, spotted owls selected low-severity burned forest and avoided moderate- and high-severity burned areas; unburned forest was used in proportion with availability. Within 1 km of the center of their foraging areas, spotted owls selected all severities of burned forest and avoided unburned forest. Beyond 1.5 km, there were no discernable differences in use patterns among burn severities. Most owls foraged in high-severity burned forest more than in all other burn categories; high-severity burned forests had greater basal area of snags and higher shrub and herbaceous cover, parameters thought to be associated with increased abundance or accessibility of prey. We recommend that burned forests within 1.5 km of nests or roosts of California spotted owls not be salvage-logged until long-term effects of fire on spotted owls and their prey are understood more fully.},

This complex reciprocal relationship has implications for the success of plant invasions and the subsequent impact of invasive species on native biota. Although much attention has been given to the role of invasive grasses in transforming fire regimes and native plant communities, little is known about the relationship between woody invasive species and fire regime. Despite this, prescribed burning is frequently used for managing invasive woody species. In this study we review relationships between woody exotic plant invasions and fire in invaded ecosystems worldwide. Woody invaders may increase or decrease aspects of the fire regime, including fire frequency, intensity and extent. This is in contrast to grass invaders which almost uniformly increase fire frequency. Woody plant invasion can lead to escape from a grass-fire cycle, but the resulting reduction in fire frequency can sometimes lead to a cycle of rare but more intense fires. Prescribed fires may be a useful management tool for controlling woody exotic invaders in some systems, but they are rarely sufficient to eliminate an invasive species, and a dearth of controlled experiments hampers evaluation of their benefits. Nevertheless, because some woody invaders have fuel properties that differ substantially from native species, understanding and managing the impacts of woody invaders on fire regimes and on prescribed burns should become an important component of resource and biodiversity management.},

We also show that experimental suppression of these pathogens increased host performance in the field, demonstrat- ing the negative effects of emerging pathogens on invasive plants. Our results suggest that invasive species can facilitate pathogen emergence and amplification, raising concerns about movement of pathogens among agricultural, horticultural, and wild grasses. However, one possible benefit of pathogen accumulation is suppression of aggressive invaders over the long term, potentially abating their negative impacts on native communities.},

  abstract = {Pervasive warming can lead to chronic stress on forest trees, which may contribute to mortality resulting from fire-caused injuries. Longitudinal analyses of forest plots from across the western US show that high pre-fire climatic water deficit was related to increased post-fire tree mortality probabilities. This relationship between climate and fire was present after accounting for fire defences and injuries, and appeared to influence the effects of crown and stem injuries. Climate and fire interactions did not vary substantially across geographical regions, major genera and tree sizes. Our findings support recent physiological evidence showing that both drought and heating from fire can impair xylem conductivity. Warming trends have been linked to increasing probabilities of severe fire weather and fire spread; our results suggest that warming may also increase forest fire severity (the number of trees killed) independent of fire intensity (the amount of heat released during a fire).},

Conversely, downhill shifts are often considered anomalous and unrelated to climate change. By comparing the altitudinal distributions of 64 plant species between the 1930s and the present day within California, we show that climate changes have resulted in a significant downward shift in species' optimum elevations. This downhill shift is counter to what would be expected given 20th-century warming but is readily explained by species' niche tracking of regional changes in climatic water balance rather than temperature. Similar downhill shifts can be expected to occur where future climate change scenarios project increases in water availability that outpace evaporative demand.},

In fact, intransitive competition has typically been studied in isolation from other pairwise stabilising processes, and thus little is known about how intransitiv-ity interacts with more traditional drivers of species coexistence such as niche partitioning. To integrate intransitivity into traditional coexistence theory, we developed a metric of growth rate when rare, Dr i , to identify and quantify the impact of intransitive competition against a backdrop of pairwise stabilising niche differences. Using this index with simulations of community dynam-ics, we demonstrate that intransitive loops can both stabilise or destabilise species coexistence, but the strength and importance of intransitive interactions are significantly affected by the length and the topology of these loops. We conclude by showing how Dr i can be used to evaluate effects of intransitivity in empirical studies. Our results emphasise the need to integrate complex mecha-nisms emerging from diverse interactions into our understanding of species coexistence.},

  doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0181305},
  abstract = {Sexual selection is an intense evolutionary force, which operates through competition for the access to breeding resources. There are many cases where male copulatory success is highly asymmetric, and few males are able to sire most females. Two main hypotheses were proposed to explain this asymmetry: ``female choice'' and ``male dominance''. The literature reports contrasting results. This variability may reflect actual differences among studied populations, but it may also be generated by methodological differences and statistical shortcomings in data analysis. A review of the statistical methods used so far in lek studies, shows a prevalence of Linear Models (LM) and Generalized Linear Models (GLM) which may be affected by problems in inferring cause-effect relationships; multi-collinearity among explanatory variables and erroneous handling of non-normal and non-continuous distributions of the response variable. In lek breeding, selective pressure is maximal, because large numbers of males and females congregate in small arenas. We used a dataset on lekking fallow deer (Dama dama), to contrast the methods and procedures employed so far, and we propose a novel approach based on Generalized Structural Equations Models (GSEMs). GSEMs combine the power and flexibility of both SEM and GLM in a unified modeling framework. We showed that LMs fail to identify several important predictors of male copulatory success and yields very imprecise parameter estimates. Minor variations in data transformation yield wide changes in results and the method appears unreliable. GLMs improved the analysis, but GSEMs provided better results, because the use of latent variables decreases the impact of measurement errors. Using GSEMs, we were able to test contrasting hypotheses and calculate both direct and indirect effects, and we reached a high precision of the estimates, which implies a high predictive ability. In synthesis, we recommend the use of GSEMs in studies on lekking behaviour, and we provide guidelines to implement these models.},

  abstract = {Restoring fire-suppressed longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) sandhill communities often includes reducing hardwood structure before re-establishing maintenance fire regimes. Using a randomized complete block design, we compared the effects of three hardwood reduction techniques (spring burning, application of the ULW?? form of the herbicide hexazinone, and midstory chainsaw felling/girdling) and a no-treatment control on oak and longleaf pine densities in fire-suppressed sandhills at Eglin Air Force Base, FL. Treatments were applied in the spring and summer of 1995. Felling/girdling and herbicide plots were also burned for fuel reduction from March to April in 1997. Frequently burned, high-quality sandhill plots were sampled to establish reference conditions. Pre-treatment diameter distributions of oaks followed a negative-exponential curve in all treatments, but were flat with low tree densities in reference plots. Oak densities were significantly reduced in the herbicide and felling/girdling plots in 1995. Compared to the controls, growing season fire topkilled up to 20\% more hardwoods among smaller trees in 1995, but this value increased to approximately 50\% after 1996. In all years, the greatest reduction of oak juvenile density (1.4 m high) was caused by herbicide application. Control plots contained significantly fewer oak juveniles than the burn and felling/girdling plots. Reference plots contained the lowest and most variable oak juvenile densities. Size distributions of longleaf pine across all plots were bimodal with modes at 0-4.9 and 25-29.9 cm in diameter. The highest mode was at 0-4.9 cm in treatment plots and at 25-29.9 cm in reference plots. Only fire quantitatively changed the distributions by the attrition of the smallest trees 1.4 m high in all years. Fire caused approximately 50\% decreases in longleaf pine juvenile 1.4 m high) density in 1995 and 1997. By 1997, median juvenile densities converged to 5-6 stems/200 m2 in all treatments, including the control. Juvenile densities were slightly higher and more variable in reference plots than in treatments. In 1997, fuel reduction burns in the herbicide and felling/girdling plots decreased densities of recently germinated longleaf pines to 5 seedlings/20 m2, a 90\% decrease compared to 1996 densities. Seedling densities dropped by approximately 50\% in control and burn plots, although these sites received no manipulations after 1995. Seedling densities only decreased by 22\% in reference plots (205 seedlings/20 m2 in 1996), which did experience some fires. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

  abstract = {Characterizing spatial patterns of fire behavior is an important and rarely considered means of understanding patterns of vegetation recovery following a fire event. Using geostatistics, we characterized spatial patterns of pre-burn fuel loads, fire temperature and duration during prescribed burns, and post-burn fuel loads in four longleaf pine stands in the southeastern USA. Fire temperatures exhibited moderate to strong spatial dependence over medium spatial scales. Variograms suggest that 61-99\% of sample population variance was spatially dependent at scales of 27-157 m. Patterns of pre-burn fuel loads were only moderately related to patterns of mean fire temperature, confirming that fuel loads alone cannot predict fire patchiness. Other fuel parameters and microscale changes in wind and relative humidity likely influenced patterns of fire intensity as well. Strength and scale of fuel load spatial patterns were altered by fire as indicated by pre- and post-burn measurements. Spatial analysis provides a useful way to quantify burn patchiness and can help to identify which patch size may be desirable for different management goals. Studies that examine fire effects need to recognize spatial autocorrelation when characterizing fire behavior and account for this variation at appropriate scales.},

  abstract = {Maintaining understory plant species diversity is an important management goal as forest restoration and fuel reduction treatments are applied extensively to dry coniferous forests of western North America. However, understory diversity is a function of both local species richness (number of species in a sample unit) and community heterogeneity (beta diversity) at multiple spatial scales, while studies of restoration treatment effects often only examine local species richness at one or two spatial scales. We studied experimental thinning and prescribed fire treatment effects on understory plant species richness and community heterogeneity at three spatial scales using additive diversity partitioning. We also evaluated treatment effects on understory plant species colonization and extirpation at two spatial scales. There was no evidence that active restoration treatments reduced species richness or increased local extirpation of species. Restoration treatments significantly increased herbaceous species richness at the treatment-unit level primarily by increasing community heterogeneity among sampling points within the units. The combination of thinning and burning produced the greatest increase in community heterogeneity, and increased colonization by species that were not sampled prior to treatment. These results suggest that restoration treatments designed primarily to reduce fire hazard and promote sustainable conditions in these fire-adapted ecosystems can also increase community heterogeneity and facilitate colonization by new understory species without significant local extirpation of extant species. \textcopyright{} 2010.},

  abstract = {There have been many attempts to model the impacts of climate change on the distributions of temperate tree species, but empirical analyses of the effects of climate on the distribution and abundance of tree species have lagged far behind the models. Here, we used forest inventory data to characterize variation in adult tree abundance along climate gradients for the 24 most common tree species in the northeastern United States. The two components of our measure of species abundance--local frequency vs. relative abundance--showed dramatically different patterns of variation along gradients of mean annual temperature and precipitation. Local frequency (i.e., the percentage of plots in a given climate in which a species occurred) varied strongly for all 24 species, particularly as a function of temperature. Relative abundance when present in a plot, on the other hand, was effectively constant for most species right up to their estimated climatic range limits. Although the range limits for both temperature and precipitation were quite broad for all of the species, the range of climates within which a species was common (i.e., high frequency) was much narrower. Because frequency in sites within a given climate shows a strong sensitivity to temperature, at least, this suggests that the processes determining canopy tree recruitment on new sites also vary strongly with climate.},

Such changes in land use have enabled humans to appropriate an increasing share of the planet's resources, but they also potentially undermine the capacity of ecosystems to sustain food production, maintain freshwater and forest resources, regulate climate and air quality, and ameliorate infectious diseases.

The study area encompassed the entire San Bernardino Mountains and included a nested, 535-km2 study area which we used to evaluate the effects of study area size on dispersal parameter estimation. One hundred and twenty-nine of the 478 banded juvenile owls (27\%) had entered the territorial population by 1998. Over half of the successful dispersers became territorial within one year. Additionally, all females and 95\% of the males occupied territories within three years. Twenty-three sibling pairs and one set of triplets dispersed successfully. Sibling dispersal distances were not correlated. Sixty-seven males and 62 females dispersed 2.3-36.4 km (mean +/- SD = 10.1 +/- 7.6 km) and 0.4-35.76 km (mean +/- 11.7 +/- 8.1 kim), respectively. The difference between male and female mean dispersal distances was not significant. Dispersal distance and first-year survival were underestimated when using data collected within the smaller, nested study area. The presence of conspecifics may play a key role in the settling process. Seventy-eight percent of the dispersers settled in territories that were occupied by either pairs or single owls the previous year, 16\% settled in vacant territories next to occupied sites, and 6\% settled at sites of unknown occupancy. No owls settled at unoccupied sites that were not adjacent to occupied sites.},

The evidence reveals that the likelihood of regime shifts may increase when humans reduce resilience by such actions as removing response diversity, removing whole functional groups of species, or removing whole trophic levels; impacting on ecosystems via emissions of waste and pollutants and climate change; and altering the magnitude, frequency, and duration of disturbance regimes. The combined and often synergistic effects of those pressures can make ecosystems more vulnerable to changes that previously could be absorbed. As a consequence, ecosystems may suddenly shift from desired to less desired states in their capacity to generate ecosystem services. Active adaptive management and governance of resilience will be required to sustain desired ecosystem states and transform degraded ecosystems into fundamentally new and more desirable configurations.},

  abstract = {Spatial scale is of great importance to understanding the spread of organisms exhibiting long-distance dispersal (LDD). We tested whether epidemics spread in direct proportion to the size of the host population and size of the initial disease focus. This was done through analysis of a previous study of the effects of landscape heterogeneity variables on the spread of accelerating epidemics of wheat (Triticum aestivum) stripe rust, caused by the fungus Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici. End-of-season disease gradients were constructed by estimating disease prevalence at regular distances from artificially inoculated foci of different sizes, in field plots of different dimensions. In one set of comparisons, all linear dimensions (plot width and length, focus width and length, and distance between observation points) differed by a factor of four. Disease spread was substantially greater in large plot/large focus treatments than in small plot/small focus treatments. However, when disease gradients were plotted using focus width as the unit distance, they were found to be highly similar, suggesting a proportional relationship between focus or plot size and disease spread. A similar relationship held when comparing same-size plots inoculated with different-sized foci, an indication that focus size is the driver of this proportionality. Our results suggest that power law dispersal of LDD organisms results in scale-invariant relationships, which are useful for better understanding spatial spread of biological invasions, extrapolating results from small-scale experiments to invasions spreading over larger scales, and predicting speed and pattern of spread as an invasion expands.},

  abstract = {Aim We test the prediction that beta diversity (species turnover) and the decay of community similarity with distance depend on spatial resolution (grain). We also study whether patterns of beta diversity are related to variability in climate, land cover or geographic distance and how the independent effects of these variables depend on the spatial grain of the data. Location Europe, Great Britain, Finland and Catalonia. Methods We used data on European birds, plants, butterflies, amphibians and reptiles, and data on British plants, Catalonian birds and Finnish butterflies. We fitted two or three nested grids of varying resolutions to each of these datasets. For each grid we calculated differences in climate, differences in land-cover composition (CORINE) and beta diversity ($\beta$sim, $\beta$Jaccard) between all pairs of grid cells. In a separate analysis we looked specifically at pairs of adjacent grid cells (the first distance class). We then used variation partitioning to identify the magnitude of independent statistical associations (i.e. independent effects in the statistical sense) of climate, land cover and geographic distance with spatial patterns of beta diversity. Results Beta diversity between grid cells at any given distance decreased with increasing grain. Geographic distance was always the most important predictor of beta diversity for all pairwise comparisons at the extent of Europe. Climate and land cover had weaker but distinct and grain-dependent effects. Climate was more important at relatively coarse grains, whereas land-cover effects were stronger at finer grains. In the country-wide analyses, climate and land cover were more important than geographic distance. Climatic and land-cover models performed poorly and showed no systematic grain dependence for beta diversity between adjacent grid cells. Main conclusions We found that relationships between geographic distance and beta diversity, as well as the environmental correlates of beta diversity, are systematically grain dependent. The strong independent effect of distance indicates that, contrary to the current belief, a substantial fraction of species are missing from areas with a suitable environment. Moreover, the effects of geographic distance (at continental extents) and land cover (at fine grains) indicate that any species distribution modelling should take both environment and dispersal limitation into account.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in spatial ecology have improved our understanding of the role of large-scale animal movements. However, an unsolved problem concerns the inherent stochasticity involved in many animal search displacements and its possible adaptive value. When animals have no information about where targets (i.e., resource patches, mates, etc.) are located, different random search strategies may provide different chances to find them. Assuming random-walk models as a necessary tool to understand how animals face such environmental uncertainty, we analyze the statistical differences between two random-walk models commonly used to fit animal movement data, the Le \textasciiacute{}vy walks and the correlated random walks, and we quantify their efficiencies (i.e., the number of targets found in relation to total displacement) within a random search context. Correlated random-walk properties (i.e., scale-finite correlations) may be interpreted as the by-product of locally scanning mechanisms. Le \textasciiacute{}vy walks, instead, have fundamental properties (i.e., super-diffusivity and scale invariance) that allow a higher efficiency in random search scenarios. Specific bio- logical mechanisms related to how animals punctuate their movement with sudden reori- entations in a random search would be sufficient to sustain Le \textasciiacute{}vy walk properties. Fur- thermore, we investigate a new model (the Le \textasciiacute{}vy-modulated correlated random walk) that combines the properties of correlated and Le \textasciiacute{}vy walks. This model shows that Le \textasciiacute{}vy walk properties are robust to any behavioral mechanism providing short-range correlations in the walk. We propose that some animals may have evolved the ability of performing Le \textasciiacute{}vy walks as adaptive strategies in order to face search uncertainties. Key},

  abstract = {Answer from the hero in Leo Szilard's 1948 story ``The Mark Gable Foundation'' when asked by a wealthy entrepreneur who believes that science has progressed too quickly, what he should do to retard this progress: ``You could set up a foundation with an annual endowment of thirty million dollars. Research workers in need of funds could apply for grants, if they could make a convincing case. Have ten committees, each composed of twelve scientists, appointed to pass on these applications. Take the most active scientists out of the laboratory and make them members of these committees. ...First of all, the best scientists would be removed from their laboratories and kept busy on committees passing on applications for funds. Secondly the scientific workers in need of funds would concentrate on problems which were considered promising and were pretty certain to lead to publishable results. ...By going after the obvious, pretty soon science would dry out. Science would become something like a parlor game. ...There would be fashions. Those who followed the fashions would get grants. Those who wouldn't would not.'' There is another kind of justice than the justice of number\ldots\ldots. There is a justice of newborn worlds which cannot be counted. [1] It is fun to imagine song writers being assessed in the way that scientists are today. Bureaucrats employed by DAFTA (Ditty, Aria, Fugue and Toccata Assessment) would count the number of songs produced and rank them by which radio stations they were played on during the first two weeks after release. The song writers would soon find that producing junky Christmas tunes and cosying up to DJs from top radio stations advanced their careers more than composing proper music. It is not so funny that, in the real world of science, dodgy evaluation criteria such as impact factors and citations are dominating minds, distorting behaviour and determining careers. Modern science, particularly biomedicine, is being damaged by attempts to measure the quantity and quality of research. Scientists are ranked according to these measures, a ranking that impacts on funding of grants, competition for posts and promotion. The measures seemed, at first rather harmless, but, like cuckoos in a nest, they have grown into monsters that threaten science itself. Already, they have produced an ``audit society'' [2] in which scientists aim, and indeed are forced, to put meeting the measures above trying to understand nature and disease. The journals are evaluated according to impact factors, and scientists and departments assessed according to the impact factors of the journals they publish in. Consequently, over the last twenty years a scientist's primary aim has been downgraded from doing science to producing papers and contriving to get them into the ``best'' journals they can [3]. Now there is a new trend: the idea is to rank scientists by the numbers of citations their papers receive. Consequently, I predict that citation-fishing and citation- bartering will become major pursuits Impact factors and citations The impact factor of a journal reflects the number of times the average article is cited in the two years following publication [4,5]. Of course, there is some correlation between the quality of the work being assessed and the impact factor of the journal that publishes it, but, even so, there are many faults with this measure [6]. Note particularly that it is not the impact factor of your paper that is being added up, it is that of the journal [7]. Your paper may prove to be wrong and to have diverted and wasted the efforts of hundreds of scientists, but it will still look good on your CV and may land you a job. Truly original work usually takes longer than two years to be appreciated \textemdash{} the most important paper in biology of the 20th century was cited rarely for the first ten years [8]. An article by Ed Lewis [9], the keystone of the work that won him the Nobel Prize in 1995, was quoted little in the first two years and took six more to reach its peak rate of citations. Crucially, impact factors are distorted by positive feedback \textemdash{} many citations are not based on reading the paper but by reading other papers, particularly reviews. One study even suggested that, of cited articles, only some 20\% had actually been read [10]. Consider the 48 citations of one of our articles [11], only eight of which are appropriate to what is actually reported, leaving 40 that are either plain wrong (3) or incidental (37) \textemdash{} for these 37 a different article either could or should have been cited. Thus it may be that, in general, citations are determined more by visibility and convenience than by the content or quality of the work. Nevertheless, citations are now being used to make quantitative comparisons between scientists. The `H-index' [5] measures the total number of papers a scientist has authored and the number of citations those papers have received. If, over a lifetime of research, you have authored 50 papers that have been cited 50 or more times, then your H-index is 50. At least this measure relates to the papers themselves, which may be cited often and over many years, even if they were published in journals with low impact factors. The use of both the H-index and impact factors to evaluate scientists has increased unethical behaviour: it rewards those who gatecrash their names on to author lists.

  abstract = {Direct surveys of terrestrial vertebrates can be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. Consequently, indices are a popular method to assess wildlife population abundance. To develop such an index, we used 18 240-m transects to count houses of dusky-footed woodrats (Neotoma fuscipes) in blue oak (Quercus douglasii)-coast live oak (Q. agrifolia) woodlands of central-coastal California by variable-width line transects, point-center quarter sample points (PCQ), and fixed-width belt transects. We live-trapped woodrats during October-November 1993-1996 on 5.8-ha trapping grids surrounding these transects. All methods were good predictors of woodrat relative abundance (R(2)greater than or equal to 0.639); however, time required to delineate belt transects probably is time-prohibitive, and PCQ points may be inappropriate for other reasons. Line transects are the best method to predict woodrat abundance in central-coastal California oak woodlands.},

Demographic characteristics of the largest insular population were estimated from colour-ringing the majority of the territorial population. This owl population declined dramatically during the study period, 1987-93. 4. If the observed decline continues and similar declines are occurring in the other populations, our viability analysis predicts that this metapopulation has a high risk of going extinct in the next 30-40 years. 5. If the observed decline is due to naturally occurring environmental fluctuations (drought), and thus temporary, the model results indicate substantial decline, but a low probability of total metapopulation extinction. 6. Our results indicate that the risk of decline is quite sensitive to the correlations among population growth rates. Increased correlation increased the risk of decline.},

Hierarchical Bayes \{(HB)\} represents a modelling structure with capacity to exploit diverse sources of information, to accommodate influences that are unknown (or unknowable), and to draw inference on large numbers of latent variables and parameters that describe complex relationships. Here I summarize the structure of \{HB\} and provide examples for common spatiotemporal problems. The flexible framework means that parameters, variables and latent variables can represent broader classes of model elements than are treated in traditional models. Inference and prediction depend on two types of stochasticity, including (1) uncertainty, which describes our knowledge of fixed quantities, it applies to all 'unobservables' (latent variables and parameters), and it declines asymptotically with sample size, and (2) variability, which applies to fluctuations that are not explained by deterministic processes and does not decline asymptotically with sample size. Examples demonstrate how different sources of stochasticity impact inference and prediction and how allowance for stochastic influences can guide research.},

Fledging success was unrelated to nest type, nest tree, nest stand characteristics, or habitat type. However, nest productivity was greatest in lower elevation oak/ big-cone fir habitat (1.7 fledglings per successful nest). Nest stands were characterized by greater variation in tree size, higher canopy closure, and greater basal area of large trees compared with random points. We were able to differentiate consistently between nest and random points using discriminant function models (\~79\% correct classification).

Eighteen ``anthropogenic biomes'' were identified through empirical analysis of global population, land use, and land cover. More than 75\% of Earth's ice-free land showed evidence of alteration as a result of human residence and land use, with less than a quarter remaining as wildlands, supporting just 11\% of terrestrial net primary production. Anthropogenic biomes offer a new way forward by acknowledging human influence on global ecosystems and moving us toward models and investigations of the terrestrial biosphere that integrate human and ecological systems.},

To predict their ecosystem-wide consequences we must understand how these impacts propagate. A long-standing, but so far elusive, problem in this endeavour is how to reduce food web complexity to a mathematically tractable, but empirically relevant system. Simplification to main energy channels linking primary producers to top consumers has been recently advocated. Following this approach, we propose a general framework for the analysis of bottom-up and top-down forcing of ecosys-tems by reducing food webs to two energy pathways originating from a limiting resource shared by com-peting guilds of primary producers (e.g. edible vs. defended plants). Exploring dynamical models of such webs we find that their equilibrium responses to nutrient enrichment and top consumer harvesting are determined by only two easily measurable topological properties: the lengths of the component food chains (odd\textendash{}odd, odd\textendash{}even, or even\textendash{}even) and presence vs. absence of a generalist top consumer reconnecting the two pathways (yielding looped vs. branched webs). Many results generalise to other looped or branched web structures and the model can be easily adapted to include a detrital pathway.},

  abstract = {The northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) is a threatened subspecies and the California spotted owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) is a subspecies of special concern in the western United States. Concern for their continued viability has arisen because of habitat loss caused by timber harvesting. The taxonomic status of the northern subspecies has been the subject of continuing controversy. We investigated the phylogeographical and population genetic structure of northern and California spotted owls with special reference to their region of contact. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region sequences confirmed the existence of two well-differentiated lineages connected by a narrow hybrid zone in a region of low population density in north central California. Maximum-likelihood estimates indicated bidirectional gene flow between the lineages but limited introgression outside the region of contact. The lengths of both the mtDNA hybrid zone and the reduced density patch were similar and slightly exceeded estimates of natal dispersal distances. This suggests that the two subspecies were in secondary contact in a hybrid zone trapped by a population density trough. Consequently, the zone of interaction is expected to be geographically stable. We discovered a third, rare clade of haplotypes, which we interpreted to be a result of incomplete lineage sorting; those haplotypes result in a paraphyletic northern spotted owl with respect to the California spotted owl. A congeneric species, the barred owl (Strix varia), occasionally hybridizes with spotted owls; our results indicated an upper bound for the frequency of barred owl mtDNA haplotypes in northern spotted owl populations of 3\%.},

Here, we analyse a data set of spatially replicated studies of directional phenotypic selection from natural populations. The data set includes 60 studies, consisting of 3937 estimates of selection across an average of five populations. We performed meta-analyses to explore features characterising spatial variation in directional selection. We found that selection tends to vary mainly in strength and less in direction among populations. Although differences in the direction of selection occur among populations they do so where selection is often weakest, which may limit the potential for ongoing adaptive population divergence. Overall, we also found that spatial variation in selection appears comparable to temporal (annual) variation in selection within populations; however, several deficiencies in available data currently complicate this comparison. We discuss future research needs to further advance our understanding of spatial variation in selection.},

  abstract = {We linked radiotelemetry data from California spotted owls (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) with forest inventory data from mixed coniferous forests managed primarily via partial timber harvest practices. We estimated a discrete-choice resource selection function (RSF) based upon 21 choice sets from the forest inventories and nocturnal telemetry locations of radiotagged adult spotted owls occupying 17 home ranges. Nocturnal foraging was strongly associated with forests close to nests and small streams. The combined basal areas of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), white fir (Abies concolor), and red fir (Abies magnifica) and basal area of hardwoods ?20 cm diameter at breast height were positively and unimodally correlated to foraging habitat selection by owls, whereas the relative probability of selection decreased with increasing basal area of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa). Opportunistically collected diurnal data indicated that owls roosted in forest stands that contained greater tree densities than those used for foraging. Topographic position, habitat heterogeneity, tree species composition, and forest density also influenced foraging site selection. Because our results indicated that forests can be too dense as well as too open, the study suggests that judiciously applied silvicultural prescriptions may maintain or improve owl foraging habitat. By linking the RSF with forest- inventory data and forest-growth models specific to the region of our study, forest managers can forecast potential consequences of silvicultural options on spotted owl foraging habitat at the level of individuals or that of a population.

In this paper, we consider various aspects of complexity and how they relate to modern healthcare practice, with the aim of developing research approaches for studying complex healthcare environments. We propose a theoretical lens for understanding and studying complexity in healthcare systems based on degrees of interrelatedness of system components. We also describe, with relevant caveats, how complex healthcare systems are generally decomposable, rendering them more tractable for further study. The ideas of interrelatedness among the components of a system as a measure of complexity and functional decomposition as a mechanism for studying meaningful subcomponents of a complex system can be used as a framework for understanding complex healthcare systems. Using examples drawn from current literature and our own research, we explain the feasibility of this approach for understanding, studying, and managing complex healthcare systems.},

  abstract = {Information about how vegetation composition and structure vary quantitatively and spatially with physical environment, disturbance history, and land ownership is fundamental to regional conservation planning. However, current knowledge about patterns of vegetation variability across large regions that is spatially explicit (i.e., mapped) tends to be general and qualitative. We used spatial predictions from gradient models to examine the influence of environment, disturbance, and ownership on patterns of forest vegetation biodiversity across a large forested region, the 3-million-ha Oregon Coast Range (USA). Gradients in tree species composition were strongly associated with environment, especially climate, and insensitive to disturbance, probably because many dominant tree species are long-lived and persist throughout forest succession. In contrast, forest structure was strongly correlated with disturbance and only weakly with environmental gradients. Although forest structure differed among ownerships, differences were blurred by the presence of legacy trees that originated prior to current forest management regimes. Our multi-ownership perspective revealed biodiversity concerns and benefits not readily visible in single-ownership analyses, and all ownerships contributed to regional biodiversity values. Federal lands provided most of the late-successional and old-growth forest. State lands contained a range of forest ages and structures, including diverse young forest, abundant legacy dead wood, and much of the high-elevation true fir forest. Nonindustrial private lands provided diverse young forest and the greatest abundance of hardwood trees, including almost all of the foothill oak woodlands. Forest industry lands encompassed much early-successional forest, most of the mixed hardwood-conifer forest, and large amounts of legacy down wood. The detailed tree- and species-level data in the maps revealed regional trends that would be masked in traditional coarse-filter assessment. Although abundant, most early-successional forests originated after timber harvest and lacked legacy live and dead trees important as habitat and for other ecological functions. Many large-conifer forests that might be classified as old growth using a generalized forest cover map lacked structural features of old growth such as multilayered canopies or dead wood. Our findings suggest that regional conservation planning include all ownerships and land allocations, as well as fine-scale elements of vegetation composition and structure.},

Building upon our collective experience of multidisciplinary research and teaching in this area, we propose practical guidelines to help with effective integration among mathematical modelling, fieldwork and laboratory work. Modelling tools can be used at all steps of a field-based research programme, from the formulation of working hypotheses to field study design and data analysis. We illustrate our model-guided fieldwork framework with two case studies we have been conducting on wildlife infectious diseases: plague transmission in prairie dogs and lyssavirus dynamics in American and African bats. These demonstrate that mechanistic models, if properly integrated in research programmes, can provide a framework for holistic approaches to complex biological systems.},

  abstract = {Ecosystems are simultaneously affected by biodiversity loss and climate change, but we know little about how these factors interact. We predicted that climate warming and CO (2) -enrichment should strengthen trophic cascades by reducing the relative efficiency of predation-resistant herbivores, if herbivore consumption rate trades off with predation resistance. This weakens the insurance effect of herbivore diversity. We tested this prediction using experimental ocean warming and acidification in seagrass mesocosms. Meta-analyses of published experiments first indicated that consumption rate trades off with predation resistance. The experiment then showed that three common herbivores together controlled macroalgae and facilitated seagrass dominance, regardless of climate change. When the predation-vulnerable herbivore was excluded in normal conditions, the two resistant herbivores maintained top-down control. Under warming, however, increased algal growth outstripped control by herbivores and the system became algal-dominated. Consequently, climate change can reduce the relative efficiency of resistant herbivores and weaken the insurance effect of biodiversity.},

  doi = {10.1177/0309133309346882},
  abstract = {Landscape ecology focuses on the analysis of spatial pattern and its relationship to ecological processes. As a scientific discipline, landscape ecology has grown rapidly in recent years, supported by developments in GIS and spatial analysis techniques. Although remote sensing data are widely employed in landscape ecology research, their current and potential roles have not been evaluated critically. To provide an overview of current practice, 438 research papers published in the journal Landscape Ecology for the years 2004-2008 were examined for information about use of remote sensing. Results indicated that only 36\% of studies explicitly mentioned remote sensing. Of those that did so, aerial photographs and Landsat satellite sensor images were most commonly used, accounting for 46\% and 42\% of studies, respectively. The predominant application of remote sensing data across these studies was for thematic mapping purposes. This suggests that landscape ecologists have been relatively slow to recognize the potential value of recent developments in remote sensing technologies and methods. The review also provided evidence of a frequent lack of key detail in studies recently published in Landscape Ecology , with 75\% failing to provide any assessment of uncertainty or error relating to image classification and mapping. It is suggested that the role of remote sensing in landscape ecology might be strengthened by closer collaboration between researchers in the two disciplines, by greater integration of diverse remote sensing data with ecological data, and by increased recognition of the value of remote sensing beyond land-cover mapping and pattern description. This is illustrated by case studies drawn from Latin America (focusing on forest loss and fragmentation) and the UK (focusing on habitat quality for woodland birds). Such approaches might improve the analytical and theoretical rigour of landscape ecology, and be applied usefully to issues of outstanding societal interest, such as the impacts of environmental change on biodiversity and ecosystem services.},

Here, we propose novel theory that considers how these resource requirements can modify the interaction between the immune system and pathogens. We derive a series of models to describe the energetic interaction between the immune system and pathogens, from fully independent resources to direct competition for the same resource. We show that increasing within-host resource supply has qualitatively distinct effects under these different scenarios. In particular, we show the conditions for which pathogen load is expected to increase, decrease or even peak at intermediate resource supply. We survey the empirical literature and find evidence for all three patterns. These patterns are not explained by previous theory, suggesting that competition for host resources can have a strong influence on the outcome of disease.},

On average, home ranges of Spotted Owls were 3-4 times larger than ranges of Barred Owls, and there was little overlap of home ranges during the breeding season. Ranges of both species tended to expand during winter. Home range size of both species was negatively correlated with the amount of old forest, but the negative slope of the regression was much steeper for Spotted Owls than for Barred Owls. For both species, home ranges of individual owls typically had high overlap among seasons and years, indicating high site fidelity. Barred Owls generally occupied home ranges at lower elevations than Spotted Owls (mean = 386 +/- 27 rn vs. 750 +/- 68 m). Both species tended to use old forests more than expected, but Spotted Owls tended to use other cover types less than expected, whereas Barred Owls used most other cover types in proportion to their availability. We suggest that Spotted Owls may use larger ranges than Barred Owls because they prey selectively on a few species of nocturnal mammals, whereas Barred Owls forage more evenly across a broad range of prey types, including diurnal and aquatic species. The low overlap of Barred Owl and Spotted Owl home ranges suggests that territorial Barred Owls exclude Spotted Owls from their territories, at least during the breeding season, thus reducing the amount of habitat available to Spotted Owls.},

Using a host-parasite system involving freshwater snails, amphibians and trematode parasites, we conducted a year-long, outdoor experiment to evaluate how warming affected net parasite production, the timing of infection and the resultant pathology. Warming of 3 $^\circ$C caused snail intermediate hosts to release parasites 9 months earlier and increased infected snail mortality by fourfold, leading to decreased overlap between amphibians and parasites. As a result, warming halved amphibian infection loads and reduced pathology by 67\%, despite comparable total parasite production across temperature treatments. These results demonstrate that climate-disease theory should be expanded to account for predicted changes in host and parasite phenology, which may often be more important than changes in total parasite output for predicting climate-driven changes in disease risk.},

  doi = {10.1007/s10336-010-0544-6},
  abstract = {Understanding population dynamics is of great interest in many different contexts. Traditionally, population dynamics have often been considered in terms of individual-based demographic parameters (e. g., abundance, survival, and reproductive rates), estimation of which generally requires information from marked individuals. Alternatively, in some situations, it may be appropriate to consider population dynamics at a landscape level where the focus is shifted from numbers of individuals to the status of the population at places on the landscape. One consequence of doing so is that information from marked individuals is no longer required. Recently developed methods allow the estimation of landscape-level population vital rates in the realistic situation where the current status of the population might be misclassified via field methods (e. g., because of imperfect detection). Here, we consider the case of the California spotted owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) at the Eldorado study area in central Sierra Nevada, California, USA, where interest is in the occupancy rate of potential nesting territories, and in whether owls in an occupied territory successfully reproduced each year during 1997-2004. We analyzed the data using multistate occupancy models and found no evidence of annual variation in dynamic occupancy probabilities. There was strong evidence of annual variation in successful reproduction, with the pattern of variation being different depending on whether there was successful reproduction in the territory in the previous year. Of the three environmental variables considered, the Southern Oscillation Index appeared to be most important and explained some of the annual variation in reproduction probabilities.},

The intensive monitoring of this subspecies on public lands in Marin County, California, combined with the availability of fine-scale geographic information system (GIS) data, provided a unique opportunity to apply and evaluate a habitat-based species occurrence modeling approach at the scale most relevant to local land managers and planning agencies. We used 4 years of breeding owl survey data (1998-2001) and GIS layers representing topographic, anthropogenic, and vegetation-based landscape characteristics to build logistic regression models of owl nest-site occurrence. Models were used to develop spatial predictions of occurrence within the study area and in adjacent ecoregions, which were validated with an independent dataset. We also compared the predictive performance of two vegetation layers differing in their floristic detail and spatial accuracy. The model based on a local vegetation layer generally exhibited better model performance than the model based on the more generic regional layer. Model results indicated that forest connectivity and topographic conditions, rather than forest type or age, were the strongest predictors of nesting owl presence. Predicting outside the original study area was somewhat successful for a coastal ecoregion similar in vegetation and climate, but not better than random for a nearby inland ecoregion, suggesting that locally derived models are necessary to adequately predict nest-site occurrence. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {We monitored reproductive success of northern spotted owls (Strix occidentalis caurina) at 51 sites on Simpson Timber Company's (STC) managed, young-growth forests in northwestern California from 1991 to 1995. We compared habitat characteristics between sites with high and low fecundity at 5 spatial scales (concentric circles of 7, 50, 114, 203, and 398 ha), using 2 stratifications of annual reproductive success (upper 50\% vs. lower 50\%, and upper 25\% vs, lower 75\% of the proportion of years when greater than or equal to 1 owlet fledged). Habitat features included number of residual trees per hectare and mean proportion of 6 categories of stand age and 4 categories of basal area. Using the 50th percentile categories, we found there were higher proportions of age class 21-40 years and basal area classes 23-45 and 46-69 m(2)/ha (P less than or equal to 0.05), but lower proportions of recent clearcuts (0-5 yr) and basal area 69 m(2)/ha (P less than or equal to 0.05) at sites with high reproductive success. Using the upper 25\% and lower 75\% categories, we found there were higher proportions of basal area class 23-45 m(2)/ha, lower proportions of 61-80-year-old stands, and more residual trees per hectare at sites with high reproductive success (P less than or equal to 0.05). We also compared random sites to occupied sites via the above parameters. Spotted owl sites contained lower proportions of basal area class 23 m(2)/ha and greater proportions of class 69 m(2)/ha than did random sites (P  0.05). There was less young forest (6-40 yr) and more forest of age class 41-60 years at spotted owl than at random sites (P  0.05). Low prey abundance around spotted owl nest sites, roost sites, or both may explain why older stands with more basal area were found in higher proportions at sites with lower fecundity: Spotted owls that chose younger stands with smaller trees may have benefited from higher woodrat (Neotoma fuscipes) availability in young stands. Managing habitat by retaining residual trees and limiting clearcutting to at least 1.1 km beyond nest sites may prove useful in increasing reproductive success of northern spotted owls.},

  abstract = {We review and synthesize recent developments in the study of the spread of invasive species, emphasizing both empirical and theoretical approaches. Recent theoretical work has shown that invasive species spread is a much more complex process than the classical models suggested, as long range dispersal events can have a large influence on the rate of range expansion through time. Empirical work goes even further, emphasizing the role of spatial heterogeneity, temporal variability, other species, and evolution. As in some of the classic work on spread, the study of range expansion of invasive species provides unique opportunities to use differences between theory and data to determine the important underlying processes that control spread rates. The spatial spread of invasive species has been a subject of empirical and theoretical study for many decades (Fisher 1937; Skellam 1951). The earliest work seemed to point to a simple and robust prediction of a linear rate of spread, perhaps after some initial phase where spread was not linear (reviewed by Hengeveld 1989; Andow et al. 1990; Okubo \& Levin 2002). The problem of spread has, however, turned out to be much richer and more interesting than was supposed 20 years ago. Some recent theoretical develop-ments have called basic results into question, while others have clarified just when the earlier results should hold (Kot et al. 1996; Weinberger et al. 2002). Much more data are becoming available, and new statistical techniques are being developed to match data with theory. While the early models included only a single non-evolving species in a homogen-eous habitat with random short range dispersal, newer theory is beginning to include the effects of changing all these assumptions. The initial models of Fisher (1937) were phrased as partial differential equations that could be used to predict an asymptotic rate of spread. In the simplest form in one spatial dimension, with p(x,t) a density function for the population level as a function of spatial location x at time t, f [ p(x,t)] the per capita rate of increase of the population at spatial location x and D a measure of the mean squared displacement of individuals per unit time, the model can be written as},

  doi = {10.1111/jbi.12257},
  abstract = {Aim Climate change can lead to decreased climatic suitability within species' distributions, increased fragmentation of climatically suitable space, and/or emergence of newly suitable areas outside present distributions. Each of these extrinsic threats and opportunities potentially interacts with specific intrinsic traits of species, yet this specificity is seldom considered in risk assessments. We present an analytical framework for examining projections of climate change-induced threats and opportunities with reference to traits that are likely to mediate species' responses, and illustrate the applicability of the framework. Location Sub-Saharan Africa. Methods We applied the framework to 195 sub-Saharan African amphibians with both available bioclimatic envelope model projections for the mid-21st century and trait data. Excluded were 500 narrow-ranging species mainly from montane areas. For each of projected losses, increased fragmentation and gains of climate space, we selected potential response-mediating traits and examined the spatial overlap with vulnerability due to these traits. We examined the overlap for all species, and individually for groups of species with different combinations of threats and opportunities. Results In the Congo Basin and arid Southern Africa, projected losses for wide-ranging amphibians were compounded by sensitivity to climatic variation, and expected gains were precluded by poor dispersal ability. The spatial overlap between exposure and vulnerability was more pronounced for species projected to have their climate space contracting in situ or shifting to distant geographical areas. Our results exclude the potential exposure of narrow-ranging species to shrinking climates in the African tropical mountains. Main conclusions We illustrate the application of a framework combining spatial projections of climate change exposure with traits that are likely to mediate species' responses. Although the proposed framework carries several assumptions that require further scrutiny, its application adds a degree of realism to familiar assessments that consider all species to be equally affected by climate change-induced threats and opportunities.},

  abstract = {The spatial and temporal organization of ecological processes and features and the scales at which they occur are central topics to landscape ecology and metapopulation dynamics, and increasingly regarded as a cornerstone paradigm for understanding ecological processes. Hence, there is need for computational approaches which allow the identification of the proper spatial or temporal scales of ecological processes and the explicit integration of that information in models. For that purpose, we propose a new method (multiscale codependence analysis, MCA) to test the statistical significance of the correlations between two variables at particular spatial or temporal scales. Validation of the method (using Monte Carlo simulations) included the study of type I error rate, under five statistical significance thresholds, and of type II error rate and statistical power. The method was found to be valid, in terms of type I error rate, and to have sufficient statistical power to be useful in practice. MCA has assumptions that are met in a wide range of circumstances. When applied to model the river habitat of juvenile Atlantic salmon, MCA revealed that variables describing substrate composition of the river bed were the most influential predictors of parr abundance at 0.4-4.1 km scales whereas mean channel depth was more influential at 200-300 m scales. When properly assessed, the spatial structuring observed in nature may be used purposefully to refine our understanding of natural processes and enhance model representativeness.},

The questions concern the frequency with which invasions affect ecosystems; the circumstances under which ecosystem change is most likely; the functions that are most often affected by invaders; the relationships between changes to ecosystems, communities, and populations; the long-term responses of ecosystems to invasions; interactions between biological invasions and other anthropogenic activities and the difficulty of managing undesirable impacts of non-native species. Some questions have been answered satisfactorily, others require more data and thought, and others might benefit from being reformulated or abandoned. Actions that might speed progress include careful development of trait-based approaches; strategic collection and publication of new data, including more frequent publication of negative results; replacement of expert opinion with hard data where needed; careful consideration of whether questions really need to be answered, especially in cases where answers are being provided for managers and policy-makers; explicit attention to and testing of the domains of theories; integrating invasions better into an ecosystem context; and remembering that our predictive ability is limited and will remain so for the foreseeable future.},

I also provide two worked examples: one involving random effects and temporal autocorrelation, and a second involving phylogenetically independent contrasts.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* My goal is to provide a user-friendly and tractable implementation of SEM that also reflects the ecological and methodological processes generating data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n},

  abstract = {Movement of individual organisms is fundamental to life, quilting our planet in a rich tapestry of phenomena with diverse implications for ecosystems and humans. Movement research is both plentiful and insightful, and recent methodological advances facilitate obtaining a detailed view of individual movement. Yet, we lack a general unifying paradigm, derived from first principles, which can place movement studies within a common context and advance the development of a mature scientific discipline. This introductory article to the Movement Ecology Special Feature proposes a paradigm that integrates conceptual, theoretical, methodological, and empirical frameworks for studying movement of all organisms, from microbes to trees to elephants. We introduce a conceptual framework depicting the interplay among four basic mechanistic components of organismal movement: the internal state (why move?), motion (how to move?), and navigation (when and where to move?) capacities of the individual and the external factors affecting movement. We demonstrate how the proposed framework aids the study of various taxa and movement types; promotes the formulation of hypotheses about movement; and complements existing biomechanical, cognitive, random, and optimality paradigms of movement. The proposed framework integrates eclectic research on movement into a structured paradigm and aims at providing a basis for hypothesis generation and a vehicle facilitating the understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and spatiotemporal patterns of movement and their role in various ecological and evolutionary processes.''Now we must consider in general the common reason for moving with any movement whatever.`` (Aristotle, De Motu Animalium, 4th century B.C.)},

  abstract = {Controlling biological invasions depends on the collective decisions of resource managers across invasion zones. Regions with high land-use diversity, which we refer to as "management mosaics", may be subject to severe invasions, for two main reasons. First, as land becomes increasingly subdivided, each manager assumes responsibility for a smaller portion of the total damages imposed by invasive species; the incentive to control invasives is therefore diminished. Secondly, managers opting not to control the invasion increase control costs for neighboring land managers by allowing their lands to act as an invader propagule source. Coordination among managers can help mitigate these effects, but greater numbers - and a wider variety of land managers occupying a region hinder collective action. Here, we discuss the challenges posed by management mosaics, using a case study of the yellow starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis) invasion in the Sierra Nevada foothills of California. We suggest that the incorporation of management mosaic dynamics into invasive species research and management is essential for successful control of invasions, and provide recommendations to address this need.},

  abstract = {Fire frequency in low-elevation coniferous forests in western North America has greatly 12 declined since the late 1800s. In many areas, this has increased tree density and the proportion of 13 shade-tolerant species, reduced resource availability, and increased forest susceptibility to forest 14 insect pests and high-severity wildfire. In response, treatments are often implemented with the 15 goal of increasing ecosystem resilience by increasing resistance to disturbance. We capitalized 16 on an existing replicated study of fire and stand density treatments in a ponderosa pine (Pinus 17 18 ponderosa)-Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forest in western Montana, U.S. that experienced a naturally occurring mountain pine beetle (MPB; Dendroctonus ponderosae) 19 outbreak five years after implementation of fuels treatments. We explored whether treatment 20 effects on tree-level defense and stand structure affected resistance to MPB. Mortality from MPB 21 was highest in the denser, untreated control and burn-only treatments, with approximately 50\% 22 and 39\%, respectively, of ponderosa pine killed during the outbreak, compared to almost no 23 mortality in the thin-only and thin-burn treatments. Thinning treatments, with or without fire, 24 dramatically increased tree growth and resin ducts relative to control and burn-only treatments. 25 Prescribed burning did not increase resin ducts, but did cause changes in resin chemistry that 26 may have affected MPB communication and lowered attack success. While ponderosa pine 27 remained dominant in the thin and thin-burn treatments after the outbreak, the high pine 28 mortality in the control and burn-only treatment caused a shift in species dominance to Douglas- 29 fir. The high Douglas-fir component in the control and burn-only treatments due to 20th century 30 31 32 fire exclusion, coupled with high pine mortality from MPB, has likely reduced resilience of this forest beyond the ability to return to a ponderosa pine-dominated system in the absence of further fire or mechanical treatment. Our results show treatments designed to increase resistance 33 to high-severity fire in ponderosa pine-dominated forests in the Northern Rockies can also 34 increase resistance to MPB, even during an outbreak. This study suggests that fuel and 35 restoration treatments in fire-dependent ponderosa pine forests that reduce tree density increase 36 ecosystem resilience in the short term, while the reintroduction of fire is important for long-term 37 resilience.},

  abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms underlying ecosystem resilience - why some systems have an irreversible response to disturbances while others recover - is critical for conserving biodiversity and ecosystem function in the face of global change. Despite the widespread acceptance of a positive relationship between biodiversity and resilience, empirical evidence for this relationship remains fairly limited in scope and localized in scale. Assessing resilience at the large landscape and regional scales most relevant to land management and conservation practices has been limited by the ability to measure both diversity and resilience over large spatial scales. Here, we combined tools used in large-scale studies of biodiversity (remote sensing and trait databases) with theoretical advances developed from small-scale experiments to ask whether the functional diversity within a range of woodland and forest ecosystems influences the recovery of productivity after wildfires across the four-corner region of the United States. We additionally asked how environmental variation (topography, macroclimate) across this geographic region influences such resilience, either directly or indirectly via changes in functional diversity. Using path analysis, we found that functional diversity in regeneration traits (fire tolerance, fire resistance, resprout ability) was a stronger predictor of the recovery of productivity after wildfire than the functional diversity of seed mass or species richness. Moreover, slope, elevation, and aspect either directly or indirectly influenced the recovery of productivity, likely via their effect on microclimate, while macroclimate had no direct or indirect effects. Our study provides some of the first direct empirical evidence for functional diversity increasing resilience at large spatial scales. Our approach highlights the power of combining theory based on local-scale studies with tools used in studies at large spatial scales and trait databases to understand pressing environmental issues.},

Each class was assigned values of disturbance frequency and severity by expert judgement. A Disturbance Frequency Index for each species was calculated as the mean of the common logarithm of the disturbance frequency of all vegetation classes weighted by occurrence frequencies of this species in those classes. A Disturbance Severity Index was defined as mean disturbance severity of all vegetation classes weighted by occurrence frequencies of this species in those classes. For forest vegetation, indices were computed separately for the whole community and for the herb layer, which experiences different types of disturbance. Further, we constructed a disturbance index from vegetation structural parameters, viz. summed covers and community-weighted mean of height at maturity of species recorded in each plot for each vegetation class. We assessed all indices by comparing their values with data on functional traits of the species.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nResults$\backslash$nWe calculated values of the indices for 1248 species. The Disturbance Frequency Index and Disturbance Severity Index were correlated, but still described different responses of individual species to disturbance. The index based on vegetation structure was correlated mainly with the Disturbance Frequency Index. All indices showed strong relationships to plant traits: species with high values of all disturbance indices tended to have small seeds, to be annual and non-clonal or able to spread clonally over large distances.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nConclusions$\backslash$nConstructing species disturbance indices based on vegetation characteristics, not plant traits, is feasible and provides meaningful scores.

  abstract = {Aim Plant distributions and vegetation dynamics underpin key global phenomena, including biogeochemical cycling, ecosystem productivity and terrestrial biodiversity patterns. Aggregated and remotely collected `big data' are required to forecast the effects of global change on plant communities. We synthesize advances in developing and exploiting big data in global change plant ecology, and identify challenges to their effective use in global change studies. Location Global. Methods We explored databases, catalogues and registries with respect to their accessibility, geographical and taxonomic extent, sample bias and other types of uncertainty, from the perspective both users and contributors. We identified four kinds of big data needed to predict the impacts of global change on plant populations and communities using spatially explicit models: remotely sensed and other environmental maps, species occurrence records, community composition (plots) and species traits, especially demographics. Results Digital environmental maps, including remotely sensed data, are the most mature class of big data discussed herein whereby protocols for archiving, discovering and analysing them have developed over three decades. Species locality records are being aggregated into databases that are easy to search and access, and while methods for addressing uncertainties are a major research focus, better spatial representation is still needed. Plot data from inventories have tremendous potential for monitoring and modelling the impacts of global change on plant communities but tend to be restricted to forests or concentrated in certain geographical areas. Ongoing efforts to aggregate plot and trait data from multiple sources are challenged by their heterogeneous coverage, attributes and protocols and a lack of data standards. Main conclusions Future goals include developing systematic frameworks for selecting geospatial data, improving tools for assessing the quality of species occurrence records and increased aggregation and discoverability of plot and trait data. Aggregated data collected by scientists, not sensors, provide more meaningful insights when data collectors are involved in analysis.},

Unfortunately, the ecophysiological forces that constrain range boundaries are poorly understood, making it difficult to mechanistically project range shifts. To explore the physiological mechanisms by which drought stress controls dry range boundaries in trees, we quantified elevational variation in drought tolerance and in drought avoidance-related functional traits of a widespread gymnosperm (ponderosa pine \textendash{} Pinus ponderosa) and angiosperm (trembling aspen \textendash{} Populus tremuloides) tree species in the southwestern USA. Specifically, we quantified tree-to-tree variation in growth, water stress (predawn and midday xylem tension), drought avoidance traits (branch conductivity, leaf/needle size, tree height, leaf area-to-sapwood area ratio), and drought tolerance traits (xylem resistance to embolism, hydraulic safety margin, wood density) at the range margins and range center of each species. Although water stress increased and growth declined strongly at lower range margins of both species, ponderosa pine and aspen showed contrasting patterns of clinal trait variation. Trembling aspen increased its drought tolerance at its dry range edge by growing stronger but more carbon dense branch and leaf tissues, implying an increased cost of growth at its range boundary. By contrast, ponderosa pine showed little elevational variation in drought-related traits but avoided drought stress at low elevations by limiting transpiration through stomatal closure, such that its dry range boundary is associated with limited carbon assimilation even in average climatic conditions. Thus, the same climatic factor (drought) may drive range boundaries through different physiological mechanisms \textendash{} a result that has important implications for process-based modeling approaches to tree biogeography. Further, we show that comparing intraspecific patterns of trait variation across ranges, something rarely done in a range-limit context, helps elucidate a mechanistic understanding of range constraints.},

For species that were common to both study types, the experimental results did not match the observational data in sign or magnitude. The observational data also showed that species that flower earliest in the spring have the highest temperature sensitivities, but this trend was not reflected in the experimental data. These significant mismatches seem to be unrelated to the study length or to the degree of manipulated warming in experiments. The discrepancy between experiments and observations, however, could arise from complex interactions among multiple drivers in the observational data, or it could arise from remediable artefacts in the experiments that result in lower irradiance and drier soils, thus dampening the phenological responses to manipulated warming. Our results introduce uncertainty into ecosystem models that are informed solely by experiments and suggest that responses to climate change that are predicted using such models should be re-evaluated.},

  abstract = {In coastal marine food webs, small invertebrate herbivores (mesograzers) have long been hypothesized to occupy an important position facilitating dominance of habitat-forming macrophytes by grazing competitively superior epiphytic algae. Because of the difficulty of manipulating mesograzers in the field, however, their impacts on community organization have rarely been rigorously documented. Understanding mesograzer impacts has taken on increased urgency in seagrass systems due to declines in seagrasses globally, caused in part by widespread eutrophication favoring seagrass overgrowth by faster-growing algae. Using cage-free field experiments in two seasons (fall and summer), we present experimental confirmation that mesograzer reduction and nutrients can promote blooms of epiphytic algae growing on eelgrass (Zostera marina). In this study, nutrient additions increased epiphytes only in the fall following natural decline of mesograzers. In the summer, experimental mesograzer reduction stimulated a 447\% increase in epiphytes, appearing to exacerbate seasonal dieback of eelgrass. Using structural equation modeling, we illuminate the temporal dynamics of complex interactions between macrophytes, mesograzers, and epiphytes in the summer experiment. An unexpected result emerged from investigating the interaction network: drift macroalgae indirectly reduced epiphytes by providing structure for mesograzers, suggesting that the net effect of macroalgae on seagrass depends on macroalgal density. Our results show that mesograzers can control proliferation of epiphytic algae, that top-down and bottom-up forcing are temporally variable, and that the presence of macroalgae can strengthen top-down control of epiphytic algae, potentially contributing to eelgrass persistence.},

  abstract = {A sound monitoring of appropriate biodiversity indicators is necessary in order to assess the progress towards the internationally agreed target of halting the loss of biodiversity by 2010. However, existing monitoring schemes often do not address species richness as a key component of biodiversity directly or do so with insufficient methods. I provide an overview and assessment of the large variety of different sampling approaches for small-scale plant species richness. Major shortcomings of many of these are (i) non-uniform plot sizes or shapes; (ii) analysis of only one spatial scale despite the scale dependence of nearly all biodiversity parameters; (iii) lack of replication of smaller subplots; and (iv) exclusion of bryophytes and lichens despite their often large contribution to total plant diversity. Based on this review, I propose a new standardised sampling approach for plant diversity patterns at small scales that is applicable for a multitude of purposes and in any biome. In its basic variant, species composition is recorded on nested squares of 0.01 m2, 0.1 m2, 1 m2, 10 m2, and 100 m2, with all smaller subplots being replicated at least 3-fold and evenly spaced within the next larger plot. Not only terricolous vascular plants, but also bryophytes, lichens, macro-algae as well as non-terricolous taxa should be recorded with the any-part system, i.e. those plants are counted within a plot whose superficial parts reach over it. This approach can be used to assess plant diversity patterns (i) of individual plots of interest, (ii) along environmental gradients, (iii) within specific vegetation types, or (iv) for landscape sectors. In the latter case, the series of nested plots must be placed randomly or systematically, but irrespective of plot homogeneity. The proposed approach allows the calculation of many meaningful biodiversity indicators, while being well compatible with a range of other sampling schemes, but avoiding their shortcomings. As this approach is not very time-consuming in its basic variant, but can easily be extended for specific purposes, I suggest its use for any kind of biodiversity studies and particularly for monitoring. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We demonstrate the methodology in a 754 ha study area in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado, U.S.A., using four 0.025 ha and twenty-one 0.1 ha multi-scale vegetation plots. We recorded 330 plant species ( 1/3 the number of plants recorded in the 1074 km2 Park) in the 2.2 ha area within the plots: this represents a sampling intensity of 0.29\% of the 754 ha study site.We estimated 552 plant species, about half the plant species recorded in the Park, in just 0.7\% of the Park's area. We show how this rapid, cost-efficient methodology: (1) produces a rich information base on the patterns of native plant diversity and the distribution of non-native plant species and keystone ecosystems; and (2) can be easily adapted for other national and state parks, national forests, wildlife refuges, and nature reserves.},

From 2010 to fall of 2012, we compared two commonly used techniques, flagging and dragging, as sampling methods for nymphal I. scapularis at three sites, each with multiple sampling arrays (grids), in the eastern and central United States. Flagging and dragging collected comparable numbers of nymphs, with no consistent differences between methods. Dragging collected more nymphs than flagging in some samples, but these differences were not consistent among sites or sampling years. The ratio of nymphs collected by flagging vs dragging was not significantly related to shrub density, so habitat type did not have a strong effect on the relative efficacy of these methods. Therefore, although dragging collected more ticks in a few cases, the numbers collected by each method were so variable that neither technique had a clear advantage for sampling nymphal I. scapularis.},

In contrast, drag sampling yielded nearly twice as many A. americanum adults compared with walking surveys. I. scapularis subadults were rarely collected during walking surveys. A. americanum nymphs were collected from drags approximately 3:1 over walking surveys. Twice as many A. americanum larvae were obtained from drags compared with walking surveys. All developmental stages of A. americanum responded positively to carbon dioxide. Pitfall traps and leaf litter samples collected very few ticks. Tick distribution among habitats varied significantly with the sampling method chosen, and the relative ranking of sites with respect to tick abundance varied depending on the stage of tick sampled. Failure to recognize the biases in these commonly used sampling techniques can potentially lead to incorrect conclusions that can have significant adverse public health consequences.},

As over-dispersion (clumping of pellet groups) increases, k -- 0; conversely, as the pellet groups approach a random distribution (that is, the Poisson distribution), k -- infinity. Past application of the negative binomial distribution to pellet-group data required a common value for the parameter k in order to test for differences in mean number of pellet groups for different populations. We developed a method of testing for differences in the means of pellet-group data for 2 or more populations that does not require a common k value. Interval and point estimators of k and m were obtained by the method of maximum likelihood for a series of models where either m or k can be assumed constant for all populations.

  abstract = {Resource exploitation in lowland tropical forests is increasing and causing loss of biodiversity. Effective evaluation and management of the impacts of development on tropical forests requires appropriate assessment and monitoring tools. We propose the use of 0.1-ha multi-scale, modified Whittaker plots (MWPs) to assess and monitor vegetation in lowland tropical rainforests. We established MWPs at 4 sites to: (1) describe and compare composition and structure of the sites using MWPs, (2) compare these results to those of 1-ha permanent vegetation plots (BDPs), and (3) evaluate the ability of MWPs to detect changes in populations (statistical power). We recorded more than 400 species at each site. Species composition among the sites was distinctive, while mean abundance and basal area was similar. Comparisons between MWPs and BDPs show that they record similar species composition and abundance and that both perform equally well at detecting rare species. However, MWPs tend to record more species, and power analysis studies show that MWPs were more effective at detecting changes in the mean number of species of trees  or = 10 cm in diameter at breast height (dbh) and in herbaceous plants. Ten MWPs were sufficient to detect a change of 11\% in the mean number of herb species, and they were able to detect a 14\% change in the mean number of species of trees  or =10 cm dbh. The value of MWPs for assessment and monitoring is discussed, along with recommendations for improving the sampling design to increase power.},

  abstract = {In this paper we describe a cellular automaton (CA) simulation model developed to predict urban growth as part of a project for estimating the regional and broader impact of urbanization on the San Francisco Bay area's climate. The rules of the model are more complex than those of a typical CA and involve the use of multiple data sources, including topography, road networks, and existing settlement distributions, and their modification over time. In addition, the control parameters of the model are allowed to self-modify: that is, the CA adapts itself to the circumstances it generates, in particular, during periods of rapid growth or stagnation. In addition, the model was written to allow the accumulation of probabilistic estimates based on Monte Carlo methods. Calibration of the model has been accomplished by the use of historical maps to compare model predictions of urbanization, based solely upon the distribution in year 1900, with observed data for years 1940, 1954, 1962, 1974, and 1990. The complexity of this model has made calibration a particularly demanding step. Lessons learned about the methods, measures, and strategies developed to calibrate the model may be of use in other environmental modeling contexts. With the calibration complete, the model is being used to generate a set of future scenarios for the San Francisco Bay area along with their probabilities based on the Monte Carlo version of the model. Animated dynamic mapping of the simulations will be used to allow visualization of the impact of future urban growth.},

These environmental stressors have been the primary source of ecosystem degradation to date, and climate change is now exacerbating some of their effects.

Understanding these interactions could be critically important in the design of climate adaptation strategies, especially because actions taken by other sectors (eg energy, agriculture, transportation) to address climate change may create new ecosystem stresses.},

To generalize this well-known criterion to multiple competing species, one must take into account both the distribution of interaction strengths and community structure. Here we derive a multispecies generaliza- tion of the two-species rule in the context of symmetric Lotka- Volterra competition and obtain explicit stability conditions for ran- dom competitive communities. We then explore the influence of community structure on coexistence. Results show that both the most and least stabilized cases have striking global structures, with a nested pattern emerging in both cases. The distribution of intra- specificcoefficients leading to the most and least stabilized commu- nities also follows a predictable pattern that can be justified analyt- ically. In addition, we show that the size of the parameter space allowing for feasible communities always increases with the strength of intraspecific effects in a characteristic way that is independent of the interspecific interaction structure. We conclude by discussing possible extensions of our results to nonsymmetric competition.},

  abstract = {Emerging wildlife pathogens are an increasing threat to biodiversity. One of the most serious wildlife diseases is chytridiomycosis, caused by the fungal pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), which has been documented in over 500 amphibian species. Amphibians vary greatly in their susceptibility to Bd, with some species tolerating infection, while others experience rapid mortality. Reservoir hosts \textendash{} species that carry infection while maintaining high abundance, but are rarely killed by disease \textendash{} can increase extinction risk in highly susceptible, sympatric species. However, whether reservoir hosts amplify Bd in declining amphibian species has not been examined. We combine a laboratory study with field surveys, disease sampling, and statistical modeling to investigate the role of reservoir hosts in chytridiomycosis dynamics and species decline in an amphibian community in south-eastern Australia. We show that the non-declining common eastern froglet (Crinia signifera) is a reservoir host for Bd, with laboratory animals carrying intense infection burdens over 12 weeks and the majority of wild sampled individuals carrying intense infections. We find that the presence of C. signifera is strongly associated with Bd prevalence in the sympatric, IUCN red-listed northern corroboree frog (Pseudophryne pengilleyi). Consistent with disease amplification by a reservoir host, we find that P. pengilleyi has declined from areas with high C. signifera abundance. Our results suggest that when reservoir hosts are present, population declines can continue long after the initial emergence of Bd, highlighting an urgent need to assess extinction risk in remnant populations of other declined amphibian species. Reintroductions and in situ management strategies must focus on identifying reservoir hosts and minimizing exposure of threatened species.},

  abstract = {Intensification of weather extremes is currently emerging as one of the most important facets of climate change. Research on extreme events (``event-focused'' in contrast to ``trend-focused'') has increased in recent years and, in 2004, accounted for one-fifth of the experimental climate change studies published. Numerous examples, rang- ing from microbiology and soil science to biogeography, demonstrate how extreme weather events can accelerate shifts in species composition and distribution, thereby facilitating changes in ecosystem functioning. However, assessing the importance of extreme events for ecological processes poses a major challenge because of the very nature of such events: their effects are out of proportion to their short duration. We propose that extreme events can be characterized by statistical extremity, timing, and abruptness relative to the life cycles of the organisms affected. To test system response to changing magnitude and frequency of weather events, controlled experi- ments are useful tools. These experiments provide essential insights for science and for societies that must develop coping strategies for such events. Here, we discuss future research needs for climate change experiments in ecology. For illustration, we describe an experimental plan showing how to meet the challenge posed by changes in the frequency or magnitude of extreme events.},

Moreover, this sensitivity is relatively greater the more extreme the event.

  abstract = {The dilution effect, the hypothesis that biodiversity reduces disease risk, has received support in many systems. However, few dilution effect studies have linked mechanistic experiments to field patterns to establish both causality and ecological relevance. We conducted a series of laboratory experiments and tested the dilution effect hypothesis in an amphibian-Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) system and tested for consistency between our laboratory experiments and field patterns of amphibian species richness, host identity and Bd prevalence. In our laboratory experiments, we show that tadpoles can filter feed Bd zoospores and that the degree of suspension feeding was positively associated with their dilution potential. The obligate suspension feeder, Gastrophryne carolinensis, generally diluted the risk of chytridiomycosis for tadpoles of Bufo terrestris and Hyla cinerea, whereas tadpoles of B.~terrestris (an obligate benthos feeder) generally amplified infections for the other species. In addition, G.~carolinensis reduced Bd abundance on H.~cinerea more so in the presence than absence of B.~terrestris and B.~terrestris amplified Bd abundance on H.~cinerea more so in the absence than presence of G.~carolinensis. Also, when ignoring species identity, species richness was a significant negative predictor of Bd abundance. In our analysis of field data, the presence of Bufo spp. and Gastrophryne spp. were significant positive and negative predictors of Bd prevalence, respectively, even after controlling for climate, vegetation, anthropogenic factors (human footprint), species richness and sampling effort. These patterns of dilution and amplification supported our laboratory findings, demonstrating that the results are likely ecologically relevant. The results from our laboratory and field data support the dilution effect hypothesis and also suggest that dilution and amplification are predictable based on host traits. Our study is among the first to link manipulative experiments, in which a potential dilution mechanism is supported, with analyses of field data on species richness, host identity, spatial autocorrelation and disease prevalence.},

  abstract = {A considerable amount of disease is transmitted from animals to humans and many of these zoonoses are neglected tropical diseases. As outbreaks of SARS, avian influenza and Ebola have demonstrated, however, zoonotic diseases are serious threats to global public health and are not just problems confined to remote regions. There are two fundamental, and poorly studied, stages of zoonotic disease emergence: 'spillover', i.e. transmission of pathogens from animals to humans, and 'stuttering transmission', i.e. when limited human-to-human infections occur, leading to self-limiting chains of transmission. We developed a transparent, theoretical framework, based on a generalization of Poisson processes with memory of past human infections, that unifies these stages. Once we have quantified pathogen dynamics in the reservoir, with some knowledge of the mechanism of contact, the approach provides a tool to estimate the likelihood of spillover events. Comparisons with independent agent-based models demonstrates the ability of the framework to correctly estimate the relative contributions of human-to-human vs animal transmission. As an illustrative example, we applied our model to Lassa fever, a rodent-borne, viral haemorrhagic disease common in West Africa, for which data on human outbreaks were available. The approach developed here is general and applicable to a range of zoonoses. This kind of methodology is of crucial importance for the scientific, medical and public health communities working at the interface between animal and human diseases to assess the risk associated with the disease and to plan intervention and appropriate control measures. The Lassa case study revealed important knowledge gaps, and opportunities, arising from limited knowledge of the temporal patterns in reporting, abundance of and infection prevalence in, the host reservoir.},

Although these studies have been informative, they have usually failed to incorporate either current or predicted future, patterns of variability.

Here, we review the studies which have used experiments to assess impacts of temperature on marine, freshwater and terrestrial communities, and classify them into a set of 'generations' based on how they incorporate variability. The majority of studies have failed to incorporate extreme events. In terrestrial ecosystems in particular, experimental treatments have reduced temperature variability, when most climate models predict increased variability. Marine studies have tended to not concentrate on changes in variability, likely in part because the thermal mass of oceans will moderate variation. In freshwaters, climate change experiments have a much shorter history than in the other ecosystems, and have tended to take a relatively simple approach. We propose a new 'generation' of climate change experiments using down-scaled climate models which incorporate predicted changes in climatic variability, and describe a process for generating data which can be applied as experimental climate change treatments.},

  abstract = {A major challenge in ecology, conservation and global-change biology is to understand why biodiversity responds differently to similar environmental changes. Contingent biodiversity responses may depend on how disturbance and dispersal interact to alter variation in community composition ($\beta$-diversity) and assembly mechanisms. However, quantitative syntheses of these patterns and processes across studies are lacking. Using null-models and meta-analyses of 22 factorial experiments in herbaceous plant communities across Europe and North America, we show that disturbance diversifies communities when dispersal is limited, but homogenises communities when combined with increased immigration from the species pool. In contrast to the hypothesis that disturbance and dispersal mediate the strength of niche assembly, both processes altered $\beta$-diversity through neutral-sampling effects on numbers of individuals and species in communities. Our synthesis suggests that stochastic effects of disturbance and dispersal on community assembly play an important, but underappreciated, role in mediating biotic homogenisation and biodiversity responses to environmental change.},

  abstract = {Evaluating the distribution of species richness where biodiversity is high but has been insufficiently sampled is not an easy task. Species distribution modelling has become a useful approach for predicting their ranges, based on the relationships between species records and environmental variables. Overlapping predictions of individual distributions could be a useful strategy for obtaining estimates of species richness and composition in a region, but these estimates should be evaluated using a proper validation process, which compares the predicted richness values and composition with accurate data from independent sources. In this study, we propose a simple approach to estimate model performance for several distributional predictions generated simultaneously. This approach is particularly suitable when species distribution modelling techniques that require only presence data are used. The individual distributions for the 370 known amphibian species of Mexico were predicted using maxent to model data on their known presence (66 113 presence-only records). Distributions were subsequently overlapped to obtain a prediction of species richness. Accuracy was assessed by comparing the overall species richness values predicted for the region with observed and predicted values from 118 well-surveyed sites, each with an area of c. 100 km(2), which were identified using species accumulation curves and nonparametric estimators. The derived models revealed a remarkable heterogeneity of species richness across the country, provided information about species composition per site and allowed us to obtain a measure of the spatial distribution of prediction errors. Examining the magnitude and location of model inaccuracies, as well as separately assessing errors of both commission and omission, highlights the inaccuracy of the predictions of species distribution models and the need to provide measures of uncertainty along with the model results. The combination of a species distribution modelling method like maxent and species richness estimators offers a useful tool for identifying when the overall pattern provided by all model predictions might be representing the geographical patterns of species richness and composition, regardless of the particular quality or accuracy of the predictions for each individual species.},

  abstract = {Herbivores and pathogens impact the species composition, ecosystem function, and socioeconomic value of forests. Herbivores and pathogens are an integral part of forests, but sometimes produce undesirable effects and a degradation of forest resources. In the United States, a few species of forest pests routinely have significant impacts on up to 20 million ha of forest with economic costs that probably exceed \$1 billion/year. Climatic change could alter patterns of disturbance from herbivores and pathogens through: (1) direct effects on the development and survival of herbivores and pathogens; (2) physiological changes in tree defenses; and (3) indirect effects from changes in the abundance of natural enemies (e.g. parasitoids of insect herbivores), mutualists (e.g. insect vectors of tree pathogens), and competitors. Because of their short life cycles, mobility, reproductive potential, and physiological sensitivity to temperature, even modest climate change will have rapid impacts on the distribution and abundance of many forest insects and pathogens. We identify 32 syndromes of biotic disturbance in North American forests that should be carefully evaluated for their responses to climate change: 15 insect herbivores, browsing mammals; 12 pathogens; 1 plant parasite; and 3 undiagnosed patterns of forest decline. It is probable that climatic effects on some herbivores and pathogens will impact on biodiversity, recreation, property value, forest industry, and even water quality. Some scenarios are beneficial (e.g. decreased snow cover may increase winter mortality of some insect pests), but many are detrimental (e.g. warming tends to accelerate insect development rate and facilitate range expansions of pests and climate change tends to produce a mismatch between mature trees and their environment, which can increase vulnerability to herbivores and pathogens). Changes in forest disturbance can produce feedback to climate through affects on water and carbon flux in forest ecosystems; one alarming scenario is that climate warming may increase insect outbreaks in boreal forests, which would tend to increase forest fires and exacerbate further climate warming by releasing carbon stores from boreal ecosystems. We suggest a list of research priorities that will allow us to refine these risk assessments and adopt forest management strategies that anticipate changes in biotic disturbance regimes and mitigate the ecological, social, and economic risks.

  abstract = {The causative agent of bovine tuberculosis (bTB; Mycobacterium bovis) has a broad host range. The role of each animal species in spreading the disease depends on how transmission occurs, on the abundance of each host, and on the interactions between hosts. This paper explores differences in the roles individual host species can play in allowing M. bovis infection to persist and spread within a multi-species complex, using New Zealand as a case study.In New Zealand, four wild mammal species are frequently infected. Of these the brushtail possum is now regarded as the only true " maintenance" host. Red deer and ferrets can become maintenance hosts where their densities are exceptionally high, but more often they are " spillover" hosts, with most infection arising from moderately frequent inter-species transmission from possums. The latter situation is even more strongly the case for feral pigs. Spillover hosts may occasionally play a crucial epidemiological role by transmitting infection back to a potential maintenance host (spillback). Three key factors make spillback transmission far more epidemiologically important than its low frequency of occurrence might suggest-amplification of the reservoir of bTB, far greater spatial spread than by the maintenance host, and greater persistence of bTB in long-lived spillover hosts extending the risk of spillback far into the future. The risk of spillback is undoubtedly low, but it nonetheless determines the nature, scale and duration of management required. Eradication of the disease may require management of both the infection in maintenance hosts and reduction or elimination of any risk of spillback. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

In this study, the variability in reported Lyme disease incidence between 1993 and 2001 in seven northeastern US states was analyzed as an outcome of weather variability. For all seven states analyzed, significant (p  0.05) positive relations were found for the correlation of early summer disease incidence with the June moisture index (Palmer Hydrological Drought Index) in the region 2 years previously. The correlations may reflect enhanced nymph tick survival in wetter conditions. Few significant relations were found with same-year moisture index, which suggests that moisture has a greater effect on nymph tick survival following the insect's blood meal than before. In some states, significant correlations were observed related to warmer winter weather a year and a half prior to disease incidence, which may have been due to higher survival and activity levels of the white-footed mouse, the main host for Lyme disease-infected ticks.},

  title = {On the Role of Natural Enemies in Preventing Competitive Exclusion in Some Marine Animals and in Rain Forest Trees},
  abstract = {The following question is posed and discussed. under what environmental conditions will the action of natural enemies prevent competitive exclusion between species of their prey? My studies on marine animal populations and rain forest trees both suggest that fluctuations in the physical environment and subsequent effects on the supply of resources reduce the effectiveness of natural enemies and allow the prey to increase to sufficiently high densities that they compete for resources. Fluctuations in weather may (1) reduce the populations of enemies more than their prey, (2) allow the prey to get a head start after an unfavourable season and (3) reduce the degree of specialization of the enemies. With lesser amplitude and/or more regularity of fluctuations, natural enemies are more effective in preventing competition. However, these conditions also lead to stronger defenses by the prey and greater effectiveness of the secondary enemies attacking the ones inq uestion. In regions of very favorable physical conditions, the only defense against natural enemies seems to be rarity and widely scattered distributions, which together preclude competitive exclusion.},

  abstract = {Species' geographic range limits interest biologists and resource managers alike; however, scientists lack strong mechanistic understanding of the factors that set geographic range limits in the field, especially for animals. There exists a clear need for detailed case studies that link mechanisms to spatial dynamics and boundaries because such mechanisms allow us to predict whether climate change is likely to change a species' geographic range and, if so, how abundance in marginal populations compares to the core. The bagworm Thyridopteryx ephemeraeformis (Lepidoptera: Psychidae) is a major native pest of cedars, arborvitae, junipers, and other landscape trees throughout much of North America. Across dozens of bagworm populations spread over six degrees of latitude in the American Midwest we find latitudinal declines in fecundity and egg and pupal survivorship as one proceeds toward the northern range boundary. A spatial gradient of bagworm reproductive success emerges, which is associated with a progressive decline in local abundance and an increase in the risk of local population extinction near the species' geographic range boundary. We developed a mathematical model, completely constrained by empirically estimated parameters, to explore the relative roles of reproductive asynchrony and stage-specific survivorship in generating the range limit for this species. We find that overwinter egg mortality is the biggest constraint on bagworm persistence beyond their northern range limit. Overwinter egg mortality is directly related to winter temperatures that fall below the bagworm eggs' physiological limit. This threshold, in conjunction with latitudinal declines in fecundity and pupal survivorship, creates a nonlinear response to climate extremes that sets the geographic boundary and provides a path for predicting northward range expansion under altered climate conditions. Our mechanistic modeling approach demonstrates how species' sensitivity to climate extremes can create population tipping points not reflected in demographic responses to climate means, a distinction that is critical to successful ecological forecasting},

While this is expected to have widespread impacts on the dynamics of infectious disease through environmental forcing, empirical data are lacking. Here, we investi-gated whether seasonality, specifically the timing of spring ice-thaw, affected susceptibility to infection by the emerging pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) across a montane community of amphi-bians that are suffering declines and extirpations as a consequence of this infection. We found a robust temporal association between the timing of the spring thaw and Bd infection in two host species, where we show that an early onset of spring forced high prevalences of infection. A third highly susceptible species (the midwife toad, Alytes obstetricans) maintained a high prevalence of infection independent of time of spring thaw. Our data show that perennially overwintering midwife toad larvae may act as a year-round reservoir of infection with variation in time of spring thaw deter-mining the extent to which infection spills over into sympatric species. We used future temperature projections based on global climate models to demonstrate that the timing of spring thaw in this region will advance mark-edly by the 2050s, indicating that climate change will further force the severity of infection. Our findings on the effect of annual variability on multi-host infection dynamics show that the community-level impact of fungal infectious disease on biodiversity will need to be re-evaluated in the face of climate change.

Yet, many aspects of the basic biology and epidemiology of the pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), are still unknown, such as when and from where did Bd emerge and what is its true ecological niche? Here, we review the ecology and evolution of Bd in the Americas and highlight controversies that make this disease so enigmatic. We explore factors associated with variance in severity of epizootics focusing on the disease triangle of host susceptibility, pathogen virulence, and environment. Reevaluating the causes of the panzootic is timely given the wealth of data on Bd prevalence across hosts and communities and the recent discoveries suggesting co-evolutionary potential of hosts and Bd. We generate a new species distribution model for Bd in the Americas based on over 30,000 records and suggest a novel future research agenda. Instead of focusing on pathogen ``hot spots,'' we need to identify pathogen ``cold spots'' so that we can better understand what limits the pathogen's distribution. Finally, we introduce the concept of ``the Ghost of Epizootics Past'' to discuss expected patterns in postepizootic host communities.},

  abstract = {pPathogens are common and diverse in natural communities and have been implicated in the success of host invasions. Yet few studies have experimentally measured how pathogens impact native versus exotic hosts, particularly when individual hosts are simultaneously coinfected by diverse pathogens. To estimate effects of interactions among multiple pathogens within host individuals on both transmission of pathogens and fitness consequences for hosts, we conducted a greenhouse experiment using California grassland species: the native perennial grass italicNassella/italic (italicStipa/italic) italicpulchra/italic, the exotic annual grass italicBromus hordeaceus/italic, and three virus species, italicBarley yellow dwarf virus-PAV/italic, italicBarley yellow dwarf virus-MAV/italic, and italicCereal yellow dwarf virus-RPV/italic. In terms of virus transmission, the native host was less susceptible than the exotic host to MAV. Coinfection of PAV and MAV did not occur in any of the 157 co-inoculated native host plants. In the exotic host, PAV infection most strongly reduced root and shoot biomass, and coinfections that included PAV severely reduced biomass. Infection with single or multiple viruses did not affect biomass in the native host. However, in this species the most potentially pathogenic coinfections (PAV + MAV and PAV + MAV + RPV) did not occur. Together, these results suggest that interactions among multiple pathogens can have important consequences for host health, which may not be predictable from interactions between hosts and individual pathogens. This work addresses a key empirical gap in understanding the impact of multiple generalist pathogens on competing host species, with potential implications for population and community dynamics of native and exotic species. It also demonstrates how pathogens with relatively mild impacts independently can more substantially reduce host performance in coinfection./p},

The Enemy Release Hypothesis predicts invaders encounter reduced pathogen abundance and diversity, while the Novel Weapons Hypothesis predicts invaders carry novel pathogens that spill over to competitors. We tested these hypotheses using avian malaria (haemosporidian) infections in the invasive myna (Acridotheres tristis), which was introduced to southeastern Australia from India and was secondarily expanded to the eastern Australian coast. Mynas and native Australian birds were screened in the secondary introduction range for haemosporidians (Plasmodium and Haemoproteus spp.) and results were combined with published data from the myna's primary introduction and native ranges. We compared malaria prevalence and diversity across myna populations to test for Enemy Release and used phylogeographic analyses to test for exotic strains acting as Novel Weapons. Introduced mynas carried significantly lower parasite diversity than native mynas and significantly lower Haemoproteus prevalence than native Australian birds. Despite commonly infecting native species that directly co-occur with mynas, Haemoproteus spp. were only recorded in introduced mynas in the primary introduction range and were apparently lost during secondary expansion. In contrast, Plasmodium infections were common in all ranges and prevalence was significantly higher in both introduced and native mynas than in native Australian birds. Introduced mynas carried several exotic Plasmodium lineages that were shared with native mynas, some of which also infected native Australian birds and two of which are highly invasive in other bioregions. Our results suggest that introduced mynas may benefit through escape from Haemoproteus spp. while acting as important reservoirs for Plasmodium spp., some of which are known exotic lineages.},

In addition to parasite-modified and apparent competition leading to species exclusion or enabling coexistence, parasites and predators interact in different ways to regulate or destablize the population dynamics of their joint prey. An emerging area is the impact of parasites on intraguild predation (IGP). Parasites can increase vulnerability of infected individuals to cannibalism or predation resulting in reversed species dominance in IGP hierarchies. We discuss the potential significance of parasites for community structure and biodiversity, in particular their role in promoting species exclusion or coexistence and the impact of emerging diseases. Ongoing invasions provide examples where parasites mediate native/invader interactions and play a key role in determining the outcome of invasions. We highlight the need for more quantitative data to assess the impact of parasites on communities, and the combination of theoretical and empirical studies to examine how the effects of parasitism scale up to community-level processes.},

This study demonstrates a method for targeting the management of ecosystem services based on social values within the South Australian Murray-Darling Basin region, Australia. A total of 56 community representatives were interviewed and their values for ecosystem services were elicited and mapped. Spatial indicators of abundance, diversity, rarity, and risk were adapted from ecological science and applied to the mapped social values for ecosystem services. Those areas with the highest social value abundance, diversity, rarity, and risk scores were defined as priority areas for the management of ecosystem services. Four hotspots were located in overlapping areas of high priority for multiple spatial indicators. The ecosystem services contributing to high abundance, diversity, rarity, and risk were identified for management in these focal areas. Community suggestions for managing specific ecosystem services in focal areas were collated and synthesized. The results of this study enable the targeting of management of ecosystem service values in the landscape by identifying where high priority management areas are, specifying what services should be managed, and summarizing how they should be managed.

  abstract = {It is well documented that pathogens can affect the survival, reproduction, and growth of individual plants. Drawing together insights from diverse studies in ecology and agriculture, we evaluate the evidence for pathogens affecting competitive interactions between plants of both the same and different species. Our objective is to explore the potential ecological and evolutionary consequences of such interactions. First, we address how disease interacts with intraspecific competition and present a simple graphical model suggesting that diverse outcomes should be expected. We conclude that the presence of pathogens may have either large or minimal effects on population dynamics depending on many factors including the density-dependent compensatory ability of healthy plants and spatial patterns of infection. Second, we consider how disease can alter competitive abilities of genotypes, and thus may affect the genetic composition of populations. These genetic processes feed back on population dynamics given trade-offs between disease resistance and other fitness components. Third, we examine how the effect of disease on interspecific plant interactions may have potentially far-reaching effects on community composition. A host-specific pathogen, for example, may alter a competitive hierarchy that exists between host and non-host species. Generalist pathogens can also induce indirect competitive interactions between host species. We conclude by highlighting lacunae in our current understanding and suggest that future studies should (1) examine a broader taxonomic range of pathogens since work to date has largely focused on fungal pathogens; (2) increase the use of field competition studies; (3) follow interactions for multiple generations; (4) characterize density-dependent processes; and (5) quantify pathogen, as well as plant, population and community dynamics.},

Such indirect, interspecific interactions are labeled apparent competition. Two examples are discussed in which an observed pattern of habitat segregation was at first interpreted as evidence for direct competition, but later interpreted as apparent competition resulting from shared predation. In order to study the consequences of predator-mediated apparent competition in isolation from other complicating factors, a model community is analyzed in which there is no direct interspecific competition among the prey. An explicit necessary condition for prey species coexistence is derived for the case of one predator feeding on many prey species. This model community has several interesting properties: (1) Prey species with high relative values for a parameter r a are "keystone" species in the community; (2) prey species can be excluded from the community by "diffuse" apparent competition; (3) large changes in the niche breadth of the predator need not correspond to large changes in predator density; (4) the prey trophic level as a whole is regulated by the predator, yet each of its constituent species is regulated by both the predator and available resources; (5) increased productivity may either increase, decrease, or leave unchanged the number of species in the community; (6) a decrease in density-independent mortality may decrease species diversity. These conclusions seem to be robust to changes in the prey growth equations and to the incorporation of predator satiation. By contrast, adding prey refugia or predator switching to the model weakens these conclusions. If the predator can be satiated or switched, the elements aij comprising the community matrix may have signs opposite the long-term effect of j upon i. The effect of natural selection upon prey species coexistence is discussed. Unless ri, Ki, and ai are tightly coupled, natural selection within prey species i will tend to decrease the equilibrial abundance of species j. \textcopyright{} 1977.},

  abstract = {One evidenced based approach for exploring future agricultural land use change scenarios is Land Use Allocation (LUA). This approach can be used to support medium to long term strategic planning. Specifically, land managers can consider a number of diverse environmental social, economic and physical factors, and explore land use allocation scenarios before choosing to produce one or more commodities in a given region. One of the most successful ways to implement a LUA approach is through the integration of geoprocessing with Multi-Criteria Decision Making methods (MCDM). Leveraging this spatial MCDM modeling approach with the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) paradigm, we have developed a Spatial Model Steering (SMS) framework that enables users to explore the decision space and thus increase their awareness of the influence of key variables. In this framework a user can visually steer the LUA model key factors, explore and compare " what if" future land use scenarios by changing these factors and visualizing a range of potential LUA outcomes. In doing so, we believe that users can develop increased confidence in their understanding of the key factors governing the underlying models and ultimately obtain greater awareness of the uncertainty in the outcomes. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Hence the composition of species assemblages is an integrative response variable, and its variability can be explained by the complex interplay among several structuring factors. The thorough analysis of spatial variation in species assemblages may help infer processes shaping ecological communities. We suggest that ecological studies would benefit from the combined use of the classical statistical models of community composition data, such as constrained or unconstrained multivariate analyses of site-by-species abundance tables, with rapidly emerging and diversifying methods of spatial pattern analysis. Doing so allows one to deal with spatially explicit ecological models of beta diversity in a biogeographic context through the multiscale analysis of spatial patterns in original species data tables, including spatial characterization of fitted or residual variation from environmental models. We summarize here the recent progress for specifying spatial features through spatial weighting matrices and spatial eigenfunctions in order to define spatially constrained or scale-explicit multivariate analyses. Through a worked example on tropical tree communities, we also show the potential of the overall approach to identify significant residual spatial patterns that could arise from the omission of important unmeasured explanatory variables or processes.},

To date, disease has never been quantitatively assessed as a cause of this invasion. Using a model with field-estimated parameters, we demonstrate that pathogen presence was necessary to reverse competitive outcome and to allow exotic annual grass invasion and dominance. Although pathogen-induced reversal of a competitive hierarchy has been suggested as a mechanism of species invasion, here we quantitatively demonstrate the importance of this phenomenon by using field-derived parameters in a dynamical model. Pathogen-mediated reversals in competitive balance may be critically important for understanding past, and predicting future, invasions.},

  abstract = {1. Vector-borne pathogens and parasites can induce changes in the phenotypes of their hosts that influence the frequency and nature of host\textendash{}vector interactions and hence transmission, as documented by both empirical and theoretical studies. To the extent that implications for transmission play a significant role in shaping the evolution of parasite effects on host phenotypes, we may hypothesize that parasites exhibiting similar transmission mechanisms \textendash{} and thus profiting from similar patterns of interaction among hosts and vectors \textendash{} will have correspondingly similar effects on relevant host traits. Here, we explore this hypothesis through a survey and synthesis of literature on interactions among plant viruses, their hosts, and insect vectors.2. Insect-vectored plant viruses that differ in their modes of transmission benefit from different patterns of interaction among host plants and vectors. The transmission of persistently transmitted (PT) viruses requires that vectors feed on an infected host for a sustained period to acquire and circulate (and sometimes replicate) virions, then disperse to a new, healthy host. In contrast, non-persistently transmitted (NPT) viruses are effectively transmitted when vectors briefly probe infected hosts, acquiring virions, then rapidly disperse.3. Based on these observations, and empirical evidence from our previous work, we hypothesized that PT and NPT viruses will exhibit different effects on aspects of host phenotypes that mediate vector attraction to, arrestment on and dispersal from infected plants. Specifically, we predicted that both PT and NPT viruses would tend to enhance vector attraction to infected hosts, but that they would have contrasting effects on vector settling and feeding preferences and on vector performance, with PT viruses tending to improve host quality for vectors and promote long-term feeding and NPT viruses tending to reduce plant quality and promote rapid dispersal.4. We evaluated these hypotheses through an analysis of existing literature and found patterns broadly consistent with our expectations. This literature synthesis, together with evidence from other disease systems, suggests that transmission mechanisms may indeed be an important factor influencing the manipulative strategies of vector-borne pathogens, with significant implications for managing viral diseases in agriculture and understanding their impacts on natural plant communities.},

These variations will likely create heterogeneous, landscape-scale fire danger conditions that have never been examined in detail. We modeled the evolution of fuel moistures and the Energy Release Component (ERC) from the US National Fire Danger Rating System across the 2009 fire season using very high resolution (30. m) surface air temperature, humidity and snow ablation date models developed from a network of inexpensive weather sensors. Snow ablation date occurred as much as 28. days later on North-facing slopes than on South-facing slopes at upper elevations. South-facing slopes were hotter and drier than North-facing slopes but slope position, in addition to aspect, was also important because nocturnal air temperatures were coolest and humidity was highest in valley bottoms. These factors created heterogeneous fuel moistures and fire danger across the study area. In the late season (August and September), nocturnal cold air drainage and high relative humidity fostered fuel moisture recovery in valley bottoms, where fuel moistures and ERC values were 30\% and 45\% higher and lower, respectively at peak fire danger (September 29th). Dry fuel moistures and relatively high ERC values persisted on low elevation, South-facing slopes. The driest conditions were observed 100-200. m above the valley floor where mid-slope thermal belts frequently developed above areas of cold air pooling. We suggest that a complete understanding of these variations may help improve fire management decision making. ?? 2011.},

The current world distribution is in temperate grasslands and cereal growing areas of Argentina, Australia, Canada, Egypt, New Zealand, South Africa and the United States of America: there are no definite records from Europe or Asia. Reports of its epidemiology are reviewed to show that the fungus is unlikely to be more than a minor leaf and seed disease. It is readily seed-borne on a wide range of cereals and grasses that are traded internationally, so there have been many opportunities for it to spread beyond the limits of its natural distribution. There are no reports of economic losses associated with P. semeniperda.

  abstract = {We synthesize insights from current understanding of drought impacts at stand-to-biogeographic scales, including management options, and we identify challenges to be addressed with new research. Large stand-level shifts underway in western forests already are showing the importance of interactions involving drought, insects, and fire. Diebacks, changes in composition and structure, and shifting range limits are widely observed. In the eastern US, the effects of increasing drought are becoming better understood at the level of individual trees, but this knowledge cannot yet be confidently translated to predictions of changing structure and diversity of forest stands. While eastern forests have not experienced the types of changes seen in western forests in recent decades, they too are vulnerable to drought and could experience significant changes with increased severity, frequency, or duration in drought. Throughout the continental United States, the combination of projected large climate-induced shifts in suitable habitat from modeling studies and limited potential for the rapid migration of tree populations suggests that changing tree and forest biogeography could substantially lag habitat shifts already underway. Forest management practices can partially ameliorate drought impacts through reductions in stand density, selection of drought-tolerant species and genotypes, artificial regeneration, and the development of multistructured stands. However, silvicultural treatments also could exacerbate drought impacts unless implemented with careful attention to site and stand characteristics. Gaps in our understanding should motivate new research on the effects of interactions involving climate and other species at the stand scale and how interactions and multiple responses are represented in models. This assessment indicates that, without a stronger empirical basis for drought impacts at the stand scale, more complex models may provide limited guidance.},

  doi = {10.1111/gcb.13206},
  abstract = {Forecasting impacts of future climate change is an important challenge to biologists, both for understanding the con- sequences of different emissions trajectories and for developing adaptation measures that will minimize biodiversity loss. Existing variation provides a window into the effects of climate on species and ecosystems, but in many places does not encompass the levels or timeframes of forcing expected under directional climatic change. Experiments help us to fill in these uncertainties, simulating directional shifts to examine outcomes of new levels and sustained changes in conditions. Here, we explore the translation between short-term responses to climate variability and longer-term trajectories that emerge under directional climatic change. In a decade-long experiment, we compare effects of short- term and long-term forcings across three trophic levels in grassland plots subjected to natural and experimental varia- tion in precipitation. For some biological responses (plant productivity), responses to long-term extension of the rainy season were consistent with short-term responses, while for others (plant species richness, abundance of invertebrate herbivores and predators), there was pronounced divergence of long-term trajectories from short-term responses. These differences between biological responses mean that sustained directional changes in climate can restructure ecological relationships characterizing a system. Importantly, a positive relationship between plant diversity and pro- ductivity turned negative under one scenario of climate change, with a similar change in the relationship between plant productivity and consumer biomass. Inferences from experiments such as this form an important part of wider efforts to understand the complexities of climate change responses.},

  abstract = {Understanding the causes and consequences of rapid environmental change is an essential scientific frontier, particularly given the threat of climate- and land use-induced changes in disturbance regimes. In western North America, recent widespread insect outbreaks and wildfires have sparked acute concerns about potential insect\textendash{}fire interactions. Although previous research shows that insect activity typically does not increase wildfire likelihood, key uncertainties remain regarding insect effects on wildfire severity (i.e., ecological impact). Recent assessments indicate that outbreak severity and burn severity are not strongly associated, but these studies have been limited to specific insect or fire events. Here, we present a regional census of large wildfire severity following outbreaks of two prevalent bark beetle and defoliator species, mountain pine beetle ( Dendroctonus ponderosae ) and western spruce budworm ( Choristoneura freemani ), across the US Pacific Northwest. We first quantify insect effects on burn severity with spatial modeling at the fire event scale and then evaluate how these effects vary across the full population of insect\textendash{}fire events ( n = 81 spanning 1987\textendash{}2011). In contrast to common assumptions of positive feedbacks, we find that insects generally reduce the severity of subsequent wildfires. Specific effects vary with insect type and timing, but both insects decrease the abundance of live vegetation susceptible to wildfire at multiple time lags. By dampening subsequent burn severity, native insects could buffer rather than exacerbate fire regime changes expected due to land use and climate change. In light of these findings, we recommend a precautionary approach when designing and implementing forest management policies intended to reduce wildfire hazard and increase resilience to global change.},

  abstract = {Mosquito-borne diseases cause substantial mortality and morbidity worldwide. These impacts are widely predicted to increase as temperatures warm and extreme precipitation events become more frequent, since mosquito biology and disease ecology are strongly linked to environmental conditions. However, direct evidence linking environmental change to changes in mosquito-borne disease is rare, and the ecological mechanisms that may underpin such changes are poorly understood. Environmental drivers, such as temperature, can have non-linear, opposing impacts on the demographic rates of different mosquito life cycle stages. As such, model frameworks that can deal with fluctuations in temperature explicitly are required to predict seasonal mosquito abundance, on which the intensity and persistence of disease transmission under different environmental scenarios depends. We present a novel, temperature-dependent, delay-differential equation model, which incorporates diapause and the differential effects of temperature on the duration and mortality of each life stage and demonstrates the sensitivity of seasonal abundance patterns to inter- and intra-annual changes in temperature. Likely changes in seasonal abundance and exposure to mosquitoes under projected changes in UK temperatures are presented, showing an increase in peak vector abundance with warming that potentially increases the risk of disease outbreaks.},

This type of reporting continues to this day through regional extension blogs, by crop consultants and more formal scouting of sentential plots in the IPM PIPE network ( http://www.ipmpipe.org/ ). As our knowledge of plant disease epidemiology has increased, we have also increased our ability to detect and monitor the presence of pathogens and use this information to make management decisions in commercial production systems. The advent of phylogenetics, next-generation sequencing, and nucleic acid amplification technologies has allowed for development of sensitive and accurate assays for pathogen inoculum detection and quantification. The application of these tools is beginning to change how we manage diseases with airborne inoculum by allowing for the detection of pathogen movement instead of assuming it and by targeting management strategies to the early phases of the epidemic development when there is the greatest opportunity to reduce the rate of disease development. While there are numerous advantages to using data on inoculum presence to aid management decisions, there are limitations in what the data represent that are often unrecognized. In addition, our understanding of where and how to effectively monitor airborne inoculum is limited. There is a strong need to improve our knowledge of the mechanisms that influence inoculum dispersion across scales as particles move from leaf to leaf, and everything in between.},

Further, we argue that, although multimodel inference can be useful in natural resource management, the importance of considering causality and accurately estimating effect sizes is greater than simply considering a variety of models. Determining causation is far more valuable than simply indicating how the response variable and explanatory variables covaried within a data set, especially when the data set did not arise from a controlled experiment. Understanding the causal mechanism will provide much better predictions beyond the range of data observed.},

We identify three such assumptions and, where possible, suggest methods of improvement: (i) traits are functional to the degree that they determine individual fitness, (ii) intraspecific variation in functional traits can be largely ignored, and (iii) functional traits show general predictive relationships to measurable environmental gradients .},

  abstract = {Control schemes for infectious disease models with time-varying contact rate are analyzed. First, time-constant control schemes are introduced and studied. Specifically, a constant treatment scheme for the infected is applied to a SIR model with time-varying contact rate, which is modelled by a switching parameter. Two variations of this model are considered: one with waning immunity and one with progressive immunity. Easily verifiable conditions on the basic reproduction number of the infectious disease are established which ensure disease eradication under these constant control strategies. Pulse control schemes for epidemic models with time-varying contact rates are also studied in detail. Both pulse vaccination and pulse treatment models are applied to a SIR model with time-varying contact rate. Further, a vaccine failure model as well as a model with a reduced infective class are considered with pulse control schemes. Again, easily verifiable conditions on the basic reproduction number are developed which guarantee disease eradication. Some simulations are given to illustrate the threshold theorems developed. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Here, we critically review the ecology, epidemiology and need for monitoring of a variety of directly transmitted (Sin Nombre virus, Avian Influenza) and vector-borne (Ross River virus, West Nile virus, Lyme disease, anaplasmosis and babesiosis) zoonoses. We focus on the valuable role that existing monitoring plays in the understanding of these zoonoses, the demands for new monitoring, and how improvements can be made to existing monitoring. We also identify the fruitful outcomes which would result from implementation of the monitoring demands we have highlighted. This review aims to promote improvements in our understanding of zoonoses, their management, and public health by encouraging discussion among researchers and public health officials.},

  issn = {13541013},
  doi = {10.1111/gcb.13210},
  abstract = {Ongoing climate change is expected to shift tree species distribution and therefore affect forest biodiversity and ecosystem services. To assess and project tree distributional shifts, researchers may compare the distribution of juvenile and adult trees under the assumption that differences between tree life-stages reflect distributional shifts triggered by climate change. However, the distribution of tree life-stages could differ within the lifespan of trees, therefore we hypothesize that currently observed distributional differences could represent shifts over ontogeny as opposed to climatically driven changes. Here we test this hypothesis with data from 1435 plots resurveyed after more than three decades across the Western Carpathians. We compared seedling, sapling and adult distribution of 12 tree species along elevation, temperature and precipitation gradients. We analyzed i) temporal shifts between the surveys and ii) distributional differences between tree life-stages within both surveys. Despite climate warming, tree species distribution of any life-stage did not shift directionally upward along elevation between the surveys. Temporal elevational shifts were species-specific and an order of magnitude lower than differences among tree life-stages within the surveys. Our results show that the observed range shifts among tree life-stages are more consistent with ontogenetic differences in the species' environmental requirements than with responses to recent climate change. The distribution of seedlings substantially differed from saplings and adults, while the distribution of saplings did not differ from adults, indicating a critical transition between seedling and sapling tree life-stages. Future research has to take ontogenetic differences among life-stages into account as we found that distributional differences recently observed worldwide may not reflect climate change but rather the different environmental requirements of tree life-stages.},

  abstract = {Given the role of infectious disease in global pollinator decline, there is a need to understand factors that shape pathogen susceptibility and transmission in bees. Here we ask how urbanization affects the immune response and pathogen load of feral and managed colonies of honey bees (Apis mellifera Linnaeus), the predominant economically important pollinator worldwide. Using quantitative real-time PCR, we measured expression of 4 immune genes and relative abundance of 10 honey bee pathogens. We also measured worker survival in a laboratory bioassay. We found that pathogen pressure on honey bees increased with urbanization and management, and the probability of worker survival declined 3-fold along our urbanization gradient. The effect of management on pathogens appears to be mediated by immunity, with feral bees expressing immune genes at nearly twice the levels of managed bees following an immune challenge. The effect of urbanization, however, was not linked with immunity; instead, urbanization may favor viability and transmission of some disease agents. Feral colonies, with lower disease burdens and stronger immune responses, may illuminate ways to improve honey bee management. The previously unexamined effects of urbanization on honey-bee disease are concerning, suggesting that urban areas may favor problematic diseases of pollinators.},

  doi = {10.1186/1475-2875-6-26},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Anopheles dirus complex includes efficient malaria vectors of the Asian forested zone. Studies suggest ecological and biological differences between the species of the complex but variations within species suggest possible environmental influences. Behavioural variation might determine vector capacity and adaptation to changing environment. It is thus necessary to clarify the species distributions and the influences of environment on behavioural heterogeneity. METHODS: A literature review highlights variation between species, influences of environmental drivers, and consequences on vector status and control. The localisation of collection sites from the literature and from a recent project (MALVECASIA) produces detailed species distributions maps. These facilitate species identification and analysis of environmental influences. RESULTS: The maps give a good overview of species distributions. If species status partly explains behavioural heterogeneity, occurrence and vectorial status, some environmental drivers have at least the same importance. Those include rainfall, temperature, humidity, shade, soil type, water chemistry and moon phase. Most factors are probably constantly favourable in forest. Biological specificities, behaviour and high human-vector contact in the forest can explain the association of this complex with high malaria prevalence, multi-drug resistant Plasmodium falciparum and partial control failure of forest malaria in Southeast Asia. CONCLUSION: Environmental and human factors seem better than species specificities at explaining behavioural heterogeneity. Although forest seems essential for mosquito survival, adaptations to orchards and wells have been recorded. Understanding the relationship between landscape components and mosquito population is a priority in foreseeing the influence of land-cover changes on malaria occurrence and in shaping control strategies for the future.},

Meta- analysis (see, e.g., Gurevitch et al. 1992; Gurevitch and Hedges 1993; Arnqvist and Wooster 1995; Curtis 1996) combines results from independent studies to examine patterns of effect across taxa or environments and, thus, may represent a powerful tool to test ecological theory. A meta-analysis requires that a common metric of effect size be extracted from each of the studies. Here, we focus on choosing a metric that best facilitates ecological inferences. We begin with a brief description of the standard definition of effect size in meta-analysis, as used in recent papers. We then discuss potential problems with this approach and suggest an alternative that is more explicitly tied to the dynamics of ecological systems. Using two examples drawn from predator-prey experiments, we then illustrate the limitations of the standard metric and the conceptual advan- tages of one ecologically based alternative. We conclude by discussing the link between metrics of effect size and ecological models.},

  abstract = {We evaluate the goals of meta-analysis, critique its recent application in ecology, and highlight an approach that more explicitly links meta-analysis and ecological theory. One goal of meta-analysis is testing null hypotheses of no response to experimental manipulations. Many ecologists, however, are more interested in quantitatively measuring processes and examining their systematic variation across systems and conditions. This latter goal requires a suite of diverse, ecologically based metrics of effect size, with each appropriately matched to an ecological question of interest. By specifying ecological models, we can develop metrics of effect size that quantify the underlying process or response of interest and are insensitive to extraneous factors irrelevant to the focal question. A model will also help to delineate the set of studies that fit the question addressed by the meta-analysis. We discuss factors that can give rise to heterogeneity in effect sizes (e.g., due to differences in experimental protocol, parameter values, or the structure of the models that describe system dynamics) and illustrate this variation using some simple models of plant competition. Variation in time scale will be one of the most common factors affecting a meta-analysis, by introducing heterogeneity in effect sizes. Different metrics will apply to different time scales, and time-series data will be vital in evaluating the appropriateness of different metrics to different collections of studies. We then illustrate the application of ecological models, and associated metrics of effect size, in meta-analysis by discussing and/or synthesizing data on species interactions, mutual interference between consumers, and individual physiology. We also examine the use of metrics when no single, specific model applies to the synthesized studies. These examples illustrate that the diversity of ecological questions demands a diversity of ecologically meaningful metrics of effect size. The successful application of meta-analysis in ecology will benefit by clear and explicit linkages among ecological theory, the questions being addressed, and the metrics used to summarize the available information},

  abstract = {Mathematical models of mosquito-borne pathogen transmission originated in the early twentieth century to provide insights into how to most effectively combat malaria. The foundations of the Ross-Macdonald theory were established by 1970. Since then, there has been a growing interest in reducing the public health burden of mosquito-borne pathogens and an expanding use of models to guide their control. To assess how theory has changed to confront evolving public health challenges, we compiled a bibliography of 325 publications from 1970 through 2010 that included at least one mathematical model of mosquito-borne pathogen transmission and then used a 79-part questionnaire to classify each of 388 associated models according to its biological assumptions. As a composite measure to interpret the multidimensional results of our survey, we assigned a numerical value to each model that measured its similarity to 15 core assumptions of the Ross-Macdonald model. Although the analysis illustrated a growing acknowledgement of geographical, ecological and epidemiological complexities in modelling transmission, most models during the past 40 years closely resemble the Ross-Macdonald model. Modern theory would benefit from an expansion around the concepts of heterogeneous mosquito biting, poorly mixed mosquito-host encounters, spatial heterogeneity and temporal variation in the transmission process.},

  abstract = {Antibiotic resistance carries a fitness cost that must be overcome in order for resistance to persist over the long term. Compensatory mutations that recover the functional defects associated with resistance mutations have been argued to play a key role in overcoming the cost of resistance, but compensatory mutations are expected to be rare relative to generally beneficial mutations that increase fitness, irrespective of antibiotic resistance. Given this asymmetry, population genetics theory predicts that populations should adapt by compensatory mutations when the cost of resistance is large, whereas generally beneficial mutations should drive adaptation when the cost of resistance is small. We tested this prediction by determining the genomic mechanisms underpinning adaptation to antibiotic-free conditions in populations of the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa that carry costly antibiotic resistance mutations. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that populations founded by high-cost rifampicin-resistant mutants adapted via compensatory mutations in three genes of the RNA polymerase core enzyme, whereas populations founded by low-cost mutants adapted by generally beneficial mutations, predominantly in the quorum-sensing transcriptional regulator gene lasR. Even though the importance of compensatory evolution in maintaining resistance has been widely recognized, our study shows that the roles of general adaptation in maintaining resistance should not be underestimated and highlights the need to understand how selection at other sites in the genome influences the dynamics of resistance alleles in clinical settings.},

The study first investigates the trend of accuracy of the predicted maps from the immediate future to the distant future. Secondly, it investigates the impact of the prediction date range on the accuracy of the predicted maps. The objectives are tested for the city of Gorizia ( Italy) using three sets of map comparison techniques, Kappa coefficients, Kappa Simulation and quantity disagreement and allocation disagreement. Results show that, in addition to the model's performance, the decrease in the accuracy of the predicted maps is dependent on factors such as urban history, uncertainty of input data and accuracy of reference maps.

The model is specifically developed for the analysis of land use in small regions (e.g., a watershed or province) at a fine spatial resolution. The model structure is based on systems theory to allow the integrated analysis of land-use change in relation to socio-economic and biophysical driving factors. The model explicitly addresses the hierarchical organization of land use systems, spatial connectivity between locations and stability. Stability is incorporated by a set of variables that define the relative elasticity of the actual land-use type to conversion. The user can specify these settings based on expert knowledge or survey data. Two applications of the model in the Philippines and Malaysia are used to illustrate the functioning of the model and its validation.},

  abstract = {Understanding species diversity and disturbance relationships is important for biodiversity conservation in disturbance-driven boreal forests. Species richness and evenness may respond differently with stand development following fire. Furthermore, few studies have simultaneously accounted for the influences of climate and local site conditions on species diversity. Using forest inventory data, we examined the relationships between species richness, Shannon's index, evenness, and time since last stand-replacing fire (TSF) in a large landscape of disturbance-driven boreal forest. TSF has negative effect on species richness and Shannon's index, and a positive effect on species evenness. Path analysis revealed that the environmental variables affect richness and Shannon's index only through their effects on TSF while affecting evenness directly as well as through their effects on TSF. Synthesis and applications. Our results demonstrate that species richness and Shannon's index decrease while species evenness increases with TSF in a boreal forest landscape. Furthermore, we show that disturbance frequency, local site conditions, and climate simultaneously influence tree species diversity through complex direct and indirect effects in the studied boreal forest.},

How can the ``impacts'' of very different activities be fairly compared during peer review? Combining the experiences of successful practitioners with communication theory, I have synthesized a five- point framework that could help both proposers and reviewers craft and compare Broader Impacts dissemina- tion activities. This ``Broader Impacts Impact Framework'' summarizes best practices in communication and outreach, and can be easily used by scientists during proposal writing and review. This framework focuses on five main factors: who, why, what, how, and with whom.},

The techniques are illustrated using annual and monthly rainfall observations measured at 36 climatic stations in a 5000 km2 region of Portugal. Cross validation is used to compare the prediction performances of the three geostatistical interpolation algorithms with the straightforward linear regression of rainfall against elevation and three univariate techniques: the Thiessen polygon; inverse square distance; and ordinary kriging. Larger prediction errors are obtained for the two algorithms (inverse square distance, Thiessen polygon) that ignore both the elevation and rainfall records at surrounding stations. The three multivariate geostatistical algorithms outperform other interpolators, in particular the linear regression, which stresses the importance of accounting for spatially dependent rainfall observations in addition to the colocated elevation. Last, ordinary kriging yields more accurate predictions than linear regression when the correlation between rainfall and elevation is moderate (less than 0.75 in the case study).

AETO and APRE estimates and estimation errors were evaluated at validation stations. Estimates and computed estimation error variances (used as indicators of estimation uncertainty) were also obtained at 1913 5 km grid points. In general, estimates at validation stations were in good agreement with observed values for all interpolation methods, although modified residual kriging estimates of APRE were slightly worse than those obtained by the other two methods. Based on mean absolute error (MAE) and mean squared error (MSE) at validation stations, no method ranked clearly above other for interpolation of AETO. At grid points, AETO estimation uncertainty was improved by cokriging by about 11.5\% and 8.4\% compared with ordinary kriging and modified residual kriging, respectively. Likewise, cokriging was superior for interpolation of APRE in terms of MAE and MSE obtained at validation stations. At grid points, cokriging reduced estimation uncertainty by 18.7\% and 24.3 \% compared with ordinary kriging and modified residual kriging, respectively, whereas modified residual kriging in general did not improve ordinary kriging results. Computed estimation error variance values indicated that modified residual kriging would reduce estimation uncertainty in areas where very few weather stations are available for interpolation.},

  abstract = {Spatially distributed measurements or estimates of precipitation over a region are required for modelling of hydrologic processes and soil moisture for agricultural and natural resource management. Simple interpolation methods fail to consider the effects of topography on precipitation and may be in considerable error in mountainous regions. The performance of three geostatistical methods for making mean annual precipitation estimates on a regular grid of points in mountainous terrain was evaluated. The methods were: (1) kriging; (2) kriging elevation-detrended data; and (3) cokriging with elevation as an auxiliary variable. The study area was the Willamette River basin, a 2.9 million hectare region spanning the area between the Coast Range and the Cascade Range in western Oregon. Compared with kriging, detrended kriging and cokriging both exhibited better precision (as indicated by estimation coefficients of variation of 16 and 17\% vs. 21\%; and average absolute errors of 19 and 20 cm vs. 26 cm) and accuracy (as indicated by average errors of -1.4 and -2.0 cm vs. -5.2 cm) in the estimation of mean annual precipitation. Contour diagrams for kriging and detrended kriging exhibited smooth zonation following general elevation trends, while cokriging showed a patchier pattern more closely corresponding to local topographic features. Detrended kriging and cokriging offer improved spatially distributed precipitation estimates in mountainous terrain on the scale of a few million hectares. Application of these methods for a larger region, the Columbia River drainage in the USA (57 million hectares), was unsuccessful due to the lack of a consistent precipitation-elevation relationship at this scale. Precipitation estimation incorporating the effects of topography at larger scales will require either piecewise estimation using the methods described here or development of a physically based orographic model.},

Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA.

This paper investigates the application of statistical distance, like one minus common variance of observation time series, between data sites instead of geographical distance in interpolation. Here, as a typical representative of interpolation methods the inverse distance weighting interpolation is applied and the test data is daily precipitation observed in Austria. Choosing statistical distance instead of geographical distance in interpolation of available coarse network observations to sites of a denser network, which is not reporting for the interpolation date, yields more robust interpolation results. The most distinct performance enhancement is in or close to mountainous terrain. Therefore, application of statistical distance in the inverse distance weighting interpolation or in similar methods can parsimoniously densify the currently available observation network. Additionally, the success further motivates search for conceptual rainorography interaction models as components of spatial rain interpolation algorithms in mountainous terrain.},

Underlying assumptions of this approach are that all diversity indices, including those that weight species importance by their relative abundance (e.g., evenness), are correlated positively, and that richness accounts for a large proportion of the variance in diversity. We addressed these assumptions with data from six grassland sites using univariate and multivariate analyses of a variety of indices (species evenness, richness, rarity, dominance, and Simpson's diversity index). Univariate correlations between plant species evenness and richness were weak and negative at each site. Principal-component analyses consistently revealed two significant components of variation in diversity. Richness and evenness were largely orthogonal, with Simpson's diversity loading between them. Thus, measures of species diversity based on relative abundance, as well as richness, may be necessary to capture the full complexity of diversity in conservation studies and in experiments of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. At these and perhaps other sites, species richness was an incomplete surrogate for diversity.},

  abstract = {Species distribution modelling is widely used in epidemiology for mapping spatial patterns and the risk of introduction of diseases and vectors and also for predicting how exposure may alter given future environmental change, motivated by the high societal impact and the multiple environmental drivers of disease outbreaks. Although pathogens and vectors have historically been sparsely recorded, monitoring systems and media sources are generating novel, online data sources on occurrence. Moreover, increasing ecological realism is being incorporated into distribution modelling techniques, focussing on dispersal, biotic interactions and evolutionary constraints that shape species distributions alongside abiotic factors and biases in recording effort, common to pathogens and vectors and wildlife species. Considering pathogens and arthropod vector systems with high impact on plant, animal and human health, the present review describes how biological records for vectors and pathogens arise, introduces the concepts behind distribution models and illustrates the potential for ecologically realistic distribution models to yield insight into the establishment and spread of pathogens. Because distribution modellers aim to provide policy makers with evidence and maps for planning and evaluation of disease mitigation measures, we highlight factors that currently constrain direct translation of models to policy. Disease distributions will be better understood and mapped in the future given improved occurrence data access and integration and combined (correlative and mechanistic) modelling approaches that are developed iteratively in concert with stakeholders.},

This perspective justifies the derivation of measures of relative evenness, which give the amount of evenness relative to the maximum and minimum possible for a given richness.

These diversity measures are hypothesized to be positively and strongly correlated, but this null hypothesis has not been tested empirically. We used the results of Caswell's neutral model to generate null relationships between richness (S), evenness (J'), and proportional diversity (H'). We tested predictions of the null model against empirical relationships describing data in a literature survey and in four individual studies conducted across various scales. Empirical relationships between log S or J' and H' differed from the null model when 10 species were tested and in plants, vertebrates, and fungi. The empirical relationships were similar to the null model when 10 and 100 species were tested and in invertebrates. If 100 species were used to estimate diversity, the relation between log S and H' was negative. The strongest predictive models included log S and J'. A path analysis indicated that log S and J' were always negatively related, that empirical observations could not be explained without including indirect effects, and that differences between the partials may indicate ecological effects, which suggests that S and J' act like diversity components or that diversity should be measured using a compound statistic.},

  abstract = {Humans are altering biodiversity globally and infectious diseases are on the rise; thus, there is interest in understanding how changes to biodiversity affect disease. Here, we explore how predator diversity shapes parasite transmission. In a mesocosm experiment that manipulated predator (larval dragonflies and damselflies) density and diversity, non-intraguild (non-IG) predators that only consume free-living cercariae (parasitic trematodes) reduced meta- cercarial infections in tadpoles, whereas intraguild (IG) predators that consume both parasites and tadpole hosts did not. This likely occurred because IG predators reduced tadpole densities and anticercarial behaviors, increasing per capita exposure rates of the surviving tadpoles (i.e., via density- and trait-mediated effects) despite the consumption of parasites. A mathematical model dem- onstrated that non-IG predators reduce macroparasite infections, but IG predation weakens this ``dilution effect'' and can even amplify parasite burdens. Consistent with the experiment and model, a wet- land survey revealed that the diversity of IG predatorswas unrelated to metacercarial burdens in amphibians, but the diversity of non-IG predatorswas negatively correlatedwith infections. These results are strikingly similar to generalities that have emerged from the predator diversity\textendash{}pest biocontrol literature, suggesting that there may be general mechanisms for pest control and that biocontrol research might inform disease management and vice versa. In summary, we identified a general trait of predators\textemdash{}where they fall on an IG pre- dation continuum\textemdash{}that predicts their ability to reduce infections and possibly pests in general. Consequently, managing assemblages of predators represents an underused tool for the management of human and wildlife diseases and pest populations.},

To understand disease persistence within these communities, it is essential to know the contribution each host species makes to parasite transmission and maintenance. However, quantifying those contributions is challenging. We present a conceptual framework for classifying multihost sharing, based on key thresholds for parasite persistence. We then develop a generalized technique to quantify each species' contribution to parasite persistence, allowing natural systems to be located within the framework. We illustrate this approach using data on gastrointestinal parasites circulating within rodent communities and show that, although many parasites infect several host species, parasite persistence is often driven by just one host species. In some cases, however, parasites require multiple host species for maintenance. Our approach provides a quantitative method for differentiating these cases using minimal reliance on s...},

  abstract = {Conservation organizations are increasingly turning to landscape approaches to achieve a balance between conservation and development goals. We use six case studies in Africa and Asia to explore the role of participatory modeling with stakeholders as one of the steps towards implementing a landscape approach. The modeling was enthusiastically embraced by some stakeholders and led to impact in some cases. Different stakeholders valued the modeling exercise differently. Noteworthy was the difference between those stakeholders connected to the policy process and scientists; the presence of the former in the modeling activities is key to achieving policy impacts, and the latter were most critical of participatory modeling. Valued aspects of the modeling included stimulating cross-sector strategic thinking, and helping participants to confront the real drivers of change and to recognize trade-offs. The modeling was generally considered to be successful in building shared understanding of issues. This understanding was gained mainly in the discussions held in the process of building the model rather than in the model outputs. The model itself reflects but a few of the main elements of the usually rich discussions that preceded its finalization. Problems emerged when models became too complex. Key lessons for participatory modeling are the need for good facilitation in order to maintain a balance between ``models as stories'' and technical modeling, and the importance of inviting the appropriate stakeholders to achieve impact.},

  abstract = {Reliable global data on forest degradation and disturbances due to fire, insect pests, diseases and severe weather are important to understand ecosystem health and condition, safeguard production of goods and services and avoid negative impacts on human livelihoods. This paper presents a global analysis of forest area affected by fire, significant insect pest outbreaks, diseases and severe weather reported by countries as part of the Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015. Between 2003 and 2012, approximately 67million hectares (1.7\%) of forest land burned annually, mostly in tropical South America and Africa. In a similar reporting period, in total 142million hectares of forest land were affected by other disturbances than fire. Insect pests affected more than 85million hectares of forest, of which a major part was in temperate North America. Severe weather disturbed over 38million hectares, mostly in Asia. About 12.5million hectares were reported to be disturbed by diseases, mostly in Asia and Europe. There were strong correlations between burned forest area and the area of partial canopy cover reduction, as well as between burned forest area and net forest loss. Partial canopy cover reduction is used as a proxy for forest degradation, although it also includes land under management that is not degraded. A decreasing trend in burned forest area was found, largely accounted for by decreased area burned within the last ten years in tropical South America. However, an increasing trend in burned forest area was found in the boreal climatic domain. The data on other disturbances was not suitable for determining any year on year correlations and should be improved in future data collection exercises.},

In this paper, we advocate the Bayesian paradigm as a broader framework for multimodel inference, one in which model averaging and model selection are naturally linked, and in which the performance of AIC-based tools is naturally evaluated. Prior model weights implicitly associated with the use of AIC are seen to highly favor complex models: in some cases, all but the most highly parameterized models in the model set are virtually ignored a priori. We suggest the usefulness of the weighted BIC (Bayesian information criterion) as a computationally simple alternative to AIC, based on explicit selection of prior model probabilities rather than acceptance of default priors associated with AIC. We note, however, that both procedures are only approximate to the use of exact Bayes factors. We discuss and illustrate technical difficulties associated with Bayes factors, and suggest approaches to avoiding these difficulties in the context of model selection for a logistic regression. Our example highlights the predisposition of AIC weighting to favor complex models and suggests a need for caution in using the BIC for computing approximate posterior model weights.},

  abstract = {Host-pathogen models are essential for designing strategies for managing disease threats to humans, wild animals and domestic animals. The behaviour of these models is greatly affected by the way in which transmission between infected and susceptible hosts is modelled. Since host-pathogen models were first developed at the beginning of the 20th century, the 'mass action' assumption has almost always been used for transmission. Recently, however, it has been suggested that mass action has often been modelled wrongly. Alternative models of transmission are beginning to appear, as are empirical tests of transmission dynamics.},

  abstract = {Modelling wildlife disease poses some unique challenges. Wildlife disease systems are data poor in comparison with human or livestock disease systems, and the impact of disease on population size is often the key question of interest. This review concentrates specifically on the application of dynamic models to evaluate and guide management strategies. Models have proved useful particularly in two areas. They have been widely used to evaluate vaccination strategies, both for protecting endangered species and for preventing spillover from wildlife to humans or livestock. They have also been extensively used to evaluate culling strategies, again both for diseases in species of conservation interest and to prevent spillover. In addition, models are important to evaluate the potential of parasites and pathogens as biological control agents. The review concludes by identifying some key research gaps, which are further development of models of macroparasites, deciding on appropriate levels of complexity, modelling genetic management and connecting models to data.},

  doi = {10.2307/2265698},
  abstract = {Models that describe the spread of invading organisms often assume that the dispersal distances of propagules are normally distributed. In contrast, measured dispersal curves are typically leptokurtic, not normal. In this paper, we consider a class of models, integrodifference equations, that directly incorporate detailed dispersal data as well as population growth dynamics. We provide explicit formulas for the speed of invasion for compensatory growth and for different choices of the propagule redistribution kernel and apply these formulas to the spread of D. pseudoobscura. We observe that: (1) the speed of invasion of a spreading population is extremely sensitive to the precise shape of the redistribution kernel and, in particular, to the tail of the distribution; (2) fat-tailed kernels can generate accelerating invasions rather than constant-speed travelling waves; (3) normal redistribution kernels (and by inference, many reaction-diffusion models) may grossly underestimate rates of spread of invading populations in comparison with models that incorporate more realistic leptokurtic distributions; and (4) the relative superiority of different redistribution kernels depends, in general, on the precise magnitude of the net reproductive rate. The addition of an Allee effect to an integrodifference equation may decrease the overall rate of spread. An Allee effect may also introduce a critical range; the population must surpass this spatial threshold in order to invade successfully. Fat-tailed kernels and Allee effects provide alternative explanations for the accelerating rates of spread observed for many invasions},

  abstract = {From its inception, land-use and land-cover mapping have been major themes in remote-sensing research and applications. Although frequently considered together, land use and land cover (LULC) are defined differently, with land use referring to the economic function of the Earth's surface and land cover to its natural or engineered biophysical cover. Land cover can be observed directly using remote sensing, but land use must be inferred from the cover type. In this study, we test whether object-based image analysis (OBIA) can improve the land-cover and land-use classification in a complex agricultural landscape located along the border between Poland and Ukraine. We quantitatively compared the results of OBIA-based versus per-pixel classifications for both land cover and land use, respectively. Our results show that land-cover classification was not significantly improved when OBIA-based methods were used. Although overall classification accuracy was modest, land-use classification was sig- nificantly improved when OBIA-based methods were applied using both spectral and spatial/geometric features of image objects, but not when spectral or spatial/geometric features were used independently. Our results suggest that in anthropogenically altered landscapes where the geometry and arrangement of surface spatial structure may convey land-use information, use of OBIA-based techniques may provide a powerful tool for improving classification. 1.},

  abstract = {Aim Our understanding of the ecology and biogeography of microbes, including those that cause human disease, lags behind that for larger species. Despite recent focus on the geographical distribution of viruses and bacteria, the overall environmental distribution of human pathogens and parasites on Earth remains incompletely understood. As islands have long inspired basic ecological insights, we aimed to assess whether the microorganisms that cause human disease in modern times follow patterns common to insular plants and animals. Location Global and regional. Methods Relying on the publically accessible GIDEON database, we use the spatial distribution of nearly 300 human parasites and pathogens across 66 island countries and territories to assess the current predictive value of the `equilibrium theory' of island biogeography. The relationships between species richness and (1) island surface area and (2) distance to the nearest mainland were investigated with linear regression, and ANCOVAs were used to test for differences in these relationships with respect to pathogen ecology and taxonomy. Results Pathogen species richness increases with island surface area and decreases with distance to the nearest mainland. The effect of area is more than 10 times lower than that usually reported for macroorganisms, but is greater than the effect of distance. The strongest relationships are for pathogens that are vector-borne, zoonotic (with humans as dead-end hosts) or protozoan. Main conclusion Our results support the basic predictions of the theory: disease diversity is a positive function of island area and a negative function of island isolation. However, differences in the effects of area, distance and pathogen ecology suggest that globalization, probably through human travel and the animal trade, has softened these relationships. Parasites that primarily target non-human species, whose distributions are more constrained by island life than are those restricted to human hosts, drive the island biogeography of human disease.},

We have systematically evaluated existing uses of the ODD protocol and identified, as expected, parts of ODD needing improvement and clarification. Accordingly, we revise the definition of ODD to clarify aspects of the original version and thereby facilitate future standardization of ABM descriptions. We discuss frequently raised critiques in ODD but also two emerging, and unanticipated, benefits: ODD improves the rigorous formulation of models and helps make the theoretical foundations of large models more visible. Although the protocol was designed for ABMs, it can help with documenting any large, complex model, alleviating some general objections against such models. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

The nonlinear dynamics and complexity of pathogen transmission pose challenges in understanding its key determinants, in identifying critical points, and designing effective mitigation strategies. Mathematical modelling provides tools to explicitly represent the variability, interconnectedness, and complexity of systems, and has contributed to numerous insights and theoretical advances in disease transmission, as well as to changes in public policy, health practice, and management. In recent years, our modelling toolbox has considerably expanded due to the advancements in computing power and the need to model novel data generated by technologies such as proximity loggers and global positioning systems. In this review, we discuss the principles, advantages, and challenges associated with the most recent modelling approaches used in systems science, the interdisciplinary study of complex systems, including agent-based, network and compartmental modelling. Agent-based modelling is a powerful simulation technique that considers the individual behaviours of system components by defining a set of rules that govern how individuals ("agents") within given populations interact with one another and the environment. Agent-based models have become a recent popular choice in epidemiology to model hierarchical systems and address complex spatio-temporal dynamics because of their ability to integrate multiple scales and datasets.},

  abstract = {Stakeholder engagement, collaboration, or participation, shared learning or fact-finding, have become buzz words and hardly any environmental assessment or modelling effort today can be presented without some kind of reference to stakeholders and their involvement in the process. This is clearly a positive development, but in far too many cases stakeholders have merely been paid lip service and their engagement has consequentially been quite nominal. Nevertheless, it is generally agreed that better decisions are implemented with less conflict and more success when they are driven by stakeholders, that is by those who will be bearing their consequences. Participatory modelling, with its various types and clones, has emerged as a powerful tool that can (a) enhance the stakeholders knowledge and understanding of a system and its dynamics under various conditions, as in collaborative learning, and (b) identify and clarify the impacts of solutions to a given problem, usually related to supporting decision making, policy, regulation or management. In this overview paper we first look at the different types of stakeholder modelling, and compare participatory modelling to other frameworks that involve stakeholder participation. Based on that and on the experience of the projects reported in this issue and elsewhere, we draw some lessons and generalisations. We conclude with an outline of some future directions.},

  abstract = {The complex and dynamic nature of environmental problems requires flexible and transparent decision-making that embraces a diversity of knowledges and values. For this reason, stakeholder participation in environmental decision-making has been increasingly sought and embedded into national and international policy. Although many benefits have been claimed for participation, disillusionment has grown amongst practitioners and stakeholders who have felt let down when these claims are not realised. This review first traces the development of participatory approaches in different disciplinary and geographical contexts, and reviews typologies that can be used to categorise and select participatory methods. It then reviews evidence for normative and pragmatic benefits of participation, and evaluates limitations and drawbacks. Although few of the claims that are made have been tested, there is evidence that stakeholder participation can enhance the quality of environmental decisions by considering more comprehensive information inputs. However, the quality of decisions made through stakeholder participation is strongly dependant on the nature of the process leading to them. Eight features of best practice participation are then identified from a Grounded Theory Analysis of the literature. These features emphasise the need to replace a "tool-kit" approach, which emphasises selecting the relevant tools for the job, with an approach that emphasises participation as a process. It is argued that stakeholder participation needs to be underpinned by a philosophy that emphasises empowerment, equity, trust and learning. Where relevant, participation should be considered as early as possible and throughout the process, representing relevant stakeholders systematically. The process needs to have clear objectives from the outset, and should not overlook the need for highly skilled facilitation. Local and scientific knowledges can be integrated to provide a more comprehensive understanding of complex and dynamic socio-ecological systems and processes. Such knowledge can also be used to evaluate the appropriateness of potential technical and local solutions to environmental problems. Finally, it is argued that to overcome many of its limitations, stakeholder participation must be institutionalised, creating organisational cultures that can facilitate processes where goals are negotiated and outcomes are necessarily uncertain. In this light, participatory processes may seem very risky, but there is growing evidence that if well designed, these perceived risks may be well worth taking. The review concludes by identifying future research needs. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Community ecology is often perceived as a "mess, "given the seemingly vast number of processes that can underlie the many patterns of interest, and the apparent uniqueness of each study system. However, at the most general level, patterns in the composition and diversity of species--the subject matter of community ecology--are influenced by only four classes of process: selection, drift, speciation, and dispersal. Selection represents deterministic fitness differences among species, drift represents stochastic changes in species abundance, speciation creates new species, and dispersal is the movement of organisms across space. All theoretical and conceptual models in community ecology can be understood with respect to their emphasis on these four processes. Empirical evidence exists for all of these processes and many of their interactions, with a predominance of studies on selection. Organizing the material of community ecology according to this framework can clarify the essential similarities and differences among the many conceptual and theoretical approaches to the discipline, and it can also allow for the articulation of a very general theory of community dynamics: species are added to communities via speciation and dispersal, and the relative abundances of these species are then shaped by drift and selection, as well as ongoing dispersal to drive community dynamics.},

  doi = {10.5194/gmd-8-2597-2015},
  abstract = {pFire provides an impulsive and stochastic pathway for carbon from the terrestrial biosphere to enter the atmosphere. Despite fire emissions being of similar magnitude to net ecosystem exchange in many biomes, even the most complex dynamic vegetation models (DVMs) embedded in general circulation models contain poor representations of fire behaviour and dynamics, such as propagation and distribution of fire sizes. A model-independent methodology is developed which addresses this issue. Its focus is on the Arctic where fire is linked to permafrost dynamics and on occasion can release great amounts of carbon from carbon-rich organic soils. Connected-component labelling is used to identify individual fire events across Canada and Russia from daily, low-resolution burned area satellite products, and the obtained fire size probability distributions are validated against historical data. This allows the creation of a fire database holding information on area burned and temporal evolution of fires in space and time. A method of assimilating the statistical distribution of fire area into a DVM whilst maintaining its fire return interval is then described. The algorithm imposes a regional scale spatially dependent fire regime on a sub-scale spatially independent model; the fire regime is described by large-scale statistical distributions of fire intensity and spatial extent, and the temporal dynamics (fire return intervals) are determined locally. This permits DVMs to estimate many aspects of post-fire dynamics that cannot occur under their current representations of fire, as is illustrated by considering the modelled evolution of land cover, biomass and net ecosystem exchange after a fire./p},

  abstract = {Understanding of wind disturbance remains predominantly at a phenomenological rather than a mechanistic or predictive level. Although wind-damage surveys in forests have identified broad trends among species, sizes, and stand structures, most of these variables are unavoidably confounded in descriptive studies. To provide improved insights into the impacts of wind on forests, static winching studies allow direct measurement of wind resistance with minimal confounding of potentially influential tree features. Here we report results from a static winching study of loblolly pine (. Pinus taeda) and tulip poplar (. Liriodendron tulipifera) on the Georgia Piedmont. This study is one of only a few that directly compares tree stability (and by extension, windfirmness) between two species across a wide size range, and is apparently only the second to directly compare a conifer to a hardwood species. Because previous fires scarred some of the trees, we opportunistically recorded fire scar presence and size along with the primary predictor variables of tree size and species. Because the calculation of critical turning moment - an indication of tree stability - relies on several field measurements that are often estimated, we included a sensitivity analysis to determine the most sensitive parameters in the calculation of critical turning moment. Our analysis of critical turning moments of winched trees revealed that tree stability increased with tree size. Surprisingly, critical turning moment did not differ between species. Moreover, fire scars were associated with a non-significant trend toward reduced tree stability, a trend that may have been significant with a larger sample size. These findings suggest that interspecific differences in tree damage documented by post-event damage surveys may be due more to variation in wind load among trees, than to innate interspecific differences in tree windfirmness.},

Here, we argue that the arcsine transform should not be used in either circumstance. For binomial data, logistic regression has greater interpretability and higher power than analyses of transformed data. However, it is important to check the data for additional unexplained variation, i.e., overdispersion, and to account for it via the inclusion of random effects in the model if found. For non-binomial data, the arcsine transform is undesirable on the grounds of interpretability, and because it can produce nonsensical predictions. The logit transformation is proposed as an alternative approach to address these issues. Examples are presented in both cases to illustrate these advantages, comparing various methods of analyzing proportions including untransformed, arcsine- and logit-transformed linear models and logistic regression (with or without random effects). Simulations demonstrate that logistic regression usually provides a gain in power over other methods.},

The estimated mean date that juveniles began to disperse was 19 September in Oregon (95\% CI = 17-21 September) and 30 September in Washington (95\% CI = 25 September-4 October). Mean dispersal dates did not differ between males and females or among years. Siblings dispersed independently. Dispersal was typically initiated with a series of rapid movements away from the natal site during file first few days or weeks of dispersal, Thereafter, most juveniles settled into temporary home ranges in late October or November and remained there for several months, In February-April there was a second pulse of dispersal activity, with many owls moving considerable distances before Scaling again in their second summer, Subsequent dispersal patterns were highly variable, with Some individuals settling permanently in their second summer and others occupying a series of temporary home ranges before eventually settling on territories,when they were 2-5 years old. Final dispersal distances ranged from 0.6-111.2 km for handed juveniles arid 1,8-103.5 km for radio-marked juveniles. The distribution of dispersal distances was strongly skewed towards shorter distances, with only 8.7\% of individuals dispersing more than 50 km. Median natal dispersal distances were 14,6 kin for banded malus. 13.5 kill for radio-marked males, 24.5 km for banded females, and 22.9 km for radio-marked females. On average, banded males and females Settled within 4.2 and 7.0 territory widths of their natal sites, respectively. Maximum and final dispersal distances were largely independent of the number of days that juveniles were tracked, Although statistical tests of dispersal direction based on all owls indicated that direction of natal dispersal was non-random, the mean angular deviations and 95\% CI's associated with the samples were large, and r-values (vector length) were small. This lead us to conclude that significant test results were the result of large sample size and were not biologically meaningful. Our samples were not large enough to test whether dispersal direction from individual territories was random. In the sample of radio-marked owls, 22\% of males and 44\% of females were paired at I year of age, but only 1.5\% of males arid 1.6\% of females were actually breeding at I year of age. At 2 years of age, 68\% of males and 77\% of females were paired. but only 5.4\% of males and 2.6\% of females were breeding. In contrast to the radio-marked owls, most juveniles that were banded and relocated at I or 2 scars of age were paired, although few were breeding. Although recruitment into the territorial population typically occurred when owls were 1-5 years old, 9\% of handed juveniles were not recaptured until they were 5 years old. We suspect that our estimates of age at recruitment of banded owls are biased high because of the likelihood that some individuals were not recaptured in the first year that they entered the territorial population. A minimum of 6\% of the banded, non-juvenile owls on our demographic study areas changed territories each year (breeding dispersal), The likelihood of breeding dispersal was higher for females, young owls, owls that did not have a mate in the previous year, and owls that lost their Mate from the previous year through death or divorce. Mean and median distances dispersed by adults were shorter than for juveniles and did not differ between the sexes or study areas ((x) over bar = 6.1 km median = 15 km). Owls that were 1-2 years old tended to disperse father than owls that were 2 years old, The direction of post-natal dispersal did not differ from random. The large nonforested valleys of western Oregon (Willamette, Umpqua, Rogue Valleys) acted as barriers to dispersal between the Coast Ranges and the Cascade Mountains. However, dispersal did occur between the Coast Ranges and Cascade Mountains in the forested foothills be between the non-forested valleys. Forest landscapes traversed by dispersing owls typically included a fragmented mosaic of roads, clear-cuts, non-forest areas, and a variety of forest age classes ranging from young forests on cutower areas, to old-growth forests greater than or equal to250 years old. Our data fit the general pattern observed in birds in that females dispersed farther than males and dispersal distances were negatively skewed towards short distance dispersers. Comparison of data from radio-marked arid banded owls demonstrated that the negatively skewed distribution of dispersal distances represented the actual distribution of dispersal distances, arid was not the result of small study area bias on recaptures. We found no correlation between dispersal distance and age at first breeding, which suggests that reproductive fitness is not affected by dispersal distance. We observed only 3 cases of close inbreeding (parent-offspring or sibling pairs) in thousands of pairs of spotted owls, suggesting that dispersal results in a very low incidence of close inbreeding in the spotted owl. However, Inbreeding with more distant relatives was common.},

  abstract = {Abstract: The species richness hypothesis, which predicts that species-rich communities should be better at resisting invasions than species-poor communities, has been empirically tested many times and often poorly supported. In this paper we contrast the species richness hypothesis with four alternative hypotheses with the aim of finding better descriptors of invasion resistance. These alternative hypotheses state that resistance to invasions is determined by abiotic conditions, community saturation (i.e., the number of resident species relative to the maximum number of species that can be supported), presence/absence of key species, or weighted species richness. Weighted species richness is a weighted sum of the number of species, where each species' weight describes its contribution to resistance. We tested these hypotheses using data on the success of 571 introductions of four freshwater fish species into lakes throughout Sweden (i.e., Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), tench (Tinca tinca), zander (San...},

  abstract = {With accelerating rates of invasion being documented in many ecosystems, communities of interacting invasive species are becoming increasingly common. Opposing theories predict that invaders can either hinder or promote one another's success. Additionally, evidence suggests that co-occurring invaders can interact to amplify or mitigate one another's impacts on ecosystems. However, there has not been a quantitative review on interactions among multiple invasive animals. Here I use a meta-analysis approach to show that, across a global scale, the mean interaction among invaders was to reduce one another's performance. This pattern was consistent when considering interactions between marine animals but interactions were neutral overall in terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. Crucially, individual studies showed that neutral interactions were the most common interaction type. Further, I demonstrate that the combined ecological impacts of multiple invaders were frequently the sum of their independent effects (additive) but the mean effect was non-additive and less than predicted (antagonistic). In both meta-analyses, the disparity between the most frequent and mean interaction type indicates that case studies of multiple invasions commonly have different outcomes to global trends. These results will help predict how co-occurring invasive animals interact and assist in developing management strategies for problematic invaders in our changing world.},

  issn = {00129658},
  doi = {10.1890/14-0487.1},
  abstract = {Induced defense is a common plant strategy in response to herbivory. Although abiotic damage, such as physical wounding, pruning, and heating, can induce plant defense, the effect of such damage by large-scale abiotic disturbances on induced defenses has not been explored and could have important consequences for plant survival facing future biotic disturbances. Historically, low-severity wildfire was a widespread, frequent abiotic disturbance in many temperate coniferous forests. Native Dendroctonus and Ips bark beetles are also a common biotic disturbance agent in these forest types and can influence tree mortality patterns after wildfire. Therefore, species living in these disturbance-prone environments with strategies to survive both frequent fire and bark beetle attack should be favored. One such example is Pinus ponderosa forests of western North America. These forests are susceptible to bark beetle attack and frequent, low-severity fire was common prior to European settlement. However, since the late 1800s, frequent, low-severity fires have greatly decreased in these forests. We hypothesized that non-lethal, low-severity, wildfire induces resin duct defense in P. ponderosa and that lack of low-severity fire relaxes resin duct defense in forests dependent on frequent, low-severity fire. We first compared axial resin duct traits between trees that either survived or died from bark beetle attacks. Next, we studied axial ducts using tree cores with crossdated chronologies in several natural P. ponderosa stands before and after an individual wildfire and, also, before and after an abrupt change in fire frequency in the 20th century. We show that trees killed by bark beetles invested less in resin ducts relative to trees that survived attack, suggesting that resin duct-related traits provide resistance against bark beetles. We then show low-severity fire induces resin duct production, and finally, that resin duct production declines when fire ceases. Our results demonstrate that low-severity fire can trigger a long-lasting induced defense that may increase tree survival from subsequent herbivory.},

  doi = {10.1098/rspb.2011.1130},
  abstract = {Invasive symbioses between wood-boring insects and fungi are emerging as a new and currently uncontrollable threat to forest ecosystems, as well as fruit and timber industries throughout the world. The bark and ambrosia beetles (Curculionidae: Scolytinae and Platypodinae) constitute the large majority of these pests, and are accompanied by a diverse community of fungal symbionts. Increasingly, some invasive symbioses are shifting from non-pathogenic saprotrophy in native ranges to a prolific tree-killing in invaded ranges, and are causing significant damage. In this paper, we review the current understanding of invasive insect-fungus symbioses. We then ask why some symbioses that evolved as non-pathogenic saprotrophs, turn into major tree-killers in non-native regions. We argue that a purely pathology-centred view of the guild is not sufficient for explaining the lethal encounters between exotic symbionts and naive trees. Instead, we propose several testable hypotheses that, if correct, lead to the conclusion that the sudden emergence of pathogenicity is a new evolutionary phenomenon with global biogeographical dynamics. To date, evidence suggests that virulence of the symbioses in invaded ranges is often triggered when several factors coincide: (i) invasion into territories with naive trees, (ii) the ability of the fungus to either overcome resistance of the naive host or trigger a suicidal over-reaction, and (iii) an 'olfactory mismatch' in the insect whereby a subset of live trees is perceived as dead and suitable for colonization. We suggest that individual cases of tree mortality caused by invasive insect-fungus symbionts should no longer be studied separately, but in a global, biogeographically and phylogenetically explicit comparative framework.},

We surveyed small mammals on forest islands in Chiew Larn Reservoir in Thailand 5 to 7 and 25 to 26 years after isolation and observed the near-total loss of native small mammals within 5 years from 10-hectare (ha) fragments and within 25 years from 10- to 56-ha fragments. Based on our results, we developed an island biogeographic model and estimated mean extinction half-life (50\% of resident species disappearing) to be 13.9 years. These catastrophic extinctions were probably partly driven by an invasive rat species; such biotic invasions are becoming increasingly common in human-modified landscapes. Our results are thus particularly relevant to other fragmented forest landscapes and suggest that small fragments are potentially even more vulnerable to biodiversity loss than previously thought.},

Both ecological and geographical factors can reduce gene flow, which can lead to population divergence, but we know little of the relative strengths of these phenomena in nature. Here, we use a novel application of structural equation modelling to quantify the contributions of ecological and geographical isolation to spatial genetic divergence in 17 species of Anolis lizards. Our comparative analysis shows that although both processes contributed significantly, geographical isolation explained substantially more genetic divergence than ecological isolation (36.3 vs. 17.9\% of variance respectively), suggesting that despite the proposed ubiquity of ecological divergence, non-ecological factors play the dominant role in the evolution of spatial genetic divergence.},

For example, herpes virus spread through pilchard populations in Australia at a rate in excess of 10 000 km year(-1), and morbillivirus infections in seals and dolphins have spread at more than 3000 km year(-1). In terrestrial environments, only the epidemics of myxomatosis and calicivirus in Australian rabbits and West Nile Virus in birds in North America have rates of spread in excess of 1000 km year(-1). The rapid rates of spread of these epidemics has been attributed to flying insect vectors, but flying vectors have not been proposed for any marine pathogen. The most likely explanation for the relatively rapid spread of marine pathogens is the lack of barriers to dispersal in some parts of the ocean, and the potential for long-term survival of pathogens outside the host. These findings caution that pathogens may pose a particularly severe problem in the ocean. There is a need to develop epidemic models capable of generating these high rates of spread and obtain more estimates of disease spread rate.},

Spraying triclopyr diluted with diesel oil to 1 5 or 3.0\% on stem bases caused 64\% mean crown dieback for August applications but only 28\% averaged over the other three dates. Both frill and spray treatments reduced by about 1.5 to 3.0 times the sprout length and clump area of trees felled within 3 months of treatments, compared to untreated trees. Tanoak can be effectively controlled by treating cut surfaces when felling, and by stem injection or basal spray 3 months before harvesting or slashing for site preparation.

  abstract = {Ecologists have recognized for decades the importance of spatial scale in ecological processes and patterns, as well as the complications scale poses for understanding ecological mechanisms. Here we highlight the opportunity attention to scale offers experimental ecology. Despite many advantages to considering scale, a review of the literature indicates that multiscale experimental studies are rare. Although much work has focused on scale as a primary factor (e.g. island size), we draw attention to scale as a `lurking' variable: one which influences the relationship between two or more variables that are not usually understood to be scale-dependent. We highlight three basic observations from which scale-dependence arises: abundance increases with area, environmental conditions vary across space, and the effect of an organism on its environment is spatially limited. From these arise first-order scale-dependence, which relates an ecological variable of interest to a measure of scale. Combining first-order relationships together, we can produce second-order scale-dependencies, which occur when the relationship between two or more variables is mediated by scale. It is these relationships that are of particular interest, as they have the potential to confound experimental results. Most ecological experiments have incorporated scale either implicitly or not at all. We suggest that an explicit consideration of scale could help resolve some long-standing debates when scale is turned from a lurking variable into a working variable. Finally, we review and evaluate four different experimental sampling designs and corresponding statistical analyses that can be used to address the effects of scale in ecological experiments.},

  abstract = {Future drought is projected to occur under warmer temperature conditions as climate change progresses, referred to here as global-change-type drought, yet quantitative assessments of the triggers and potential extent of drought-induced vegetation die-off remain pivotal uncertainties in assessing climate-change impacts. Of particular concern is regional-scale mortality of overstory trees, which rapidly alters ecosystem type, associated ecosystem properties, and land surface conditions for decades. Here, we quantify regional-scale vegetation die-off across southwestern North American woodlands in 2002-2003 in response to drought and associated bark beetle infestations. At an intensively studied site within the region, we quantified that after 15 months of depleted soil water content, 90\% of the dominant, overstory tree species (Pinus edulis, a pi\~non) died. The die-off was reflected in changes in a remotely sensed index of vegetation greenness (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), not only at the intensively studied site but also across the region, extending over 12,000 km2 or more; aerial and field surveys confirmed the general extent of the die-off. Notably, the recent drought was warmer than the previous subcontinental drought of the 1950s. The limited, available observations suggest that die-off from the recent drought was more extensive than that from the previous drought, extending into wetter sites within the tree species' distribution. Our results quantify a trigger leading to rapid, drought-induced die-off of overstory woody plants at subcontinental scale and highlight the potential for such die-off to be more severe and extensive for future global-change-type drought under warmer conditions.},

Control strategies to protect public health regularly fail, due in part to the tendency to focus on a single host species assumed to be the primary reservoir for a pathogen. Here, we present evidence that a diverse set of species can play an important role in determining disease risk to humans using Lyme disease as a model. Host-targeted public health strategies to control the Lyme disease epidemic in North America have focused on interrupting Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (ss) transmission between blacklegged ticks and the putative dominant reservoir species, white-footed mice. However, B. burgdorferi ss infects more than a dozen vertebrate species, any of which could transmit the pathogen to feeding ticks and increase the density of infected ticks and Lyme disease risk. Using genetic and ecological data, we demonstrate that mice are neither the primary host for ticks nor the primary reservoir for B. burgdorferi ss, feeding 10\% of all ticks and 25\% of B. burgdorferi-infected ticks. Inconspicuous shrews feed 35\% of all ticks and 55\% of infected ticks. Because several important host species influence Lyme disease risk, interventions directed at a multiple host species will be required to control this epidemic.},

  title = {Combining {{FIA}} Plot Data with Topographic Variables: Are Precise Locations Needed?},
  abstract = {Plot data from the USFS FIA program could be combined with terrain variables to attempt to explain how terrain characteristics influence forest growth, species composition, productivity, fire behavior, wildlife habitat, and other phenomena. While some types of analyses using FIA data have been shown to be insensitive to precision of plot locations, it has been suggested that terrain-based models may require the use of precise plot coordinates. This study compares results obtained from a variety of terrain-based analyses conducted in the Blue Ridge of North Carolina using both precise and perturbed (fuzzed and swapped) FIA plot locations, and documents differences between field-estimated slope and aspect and GIS-derived slope and aspect. Digital elevation model (DEM) data were used to derive simple topographic parameters such as elevation, slope percent, azimuth of aspect, terrain curvature, flow accumulation, slope position, and compound topographic index. These values were then compared in a pairwise fashion for plots using precise and perturbed coordinates. Correlations between precise and perturbed plot locations ranged from r = -0.006 to r = 0.383, except for precise versus perturbed plot elevations where r = 0.929. Second, a simple, terrainbased forest site quality index (FSQI) was calculated for the each plot. This index defines site quality classes for forest productivity based on azimuth of aspect, slope percent, and slope position. FSQI classifications were compared for precise and perturbed plot coordinates; at best only 40\% of plots resulted in the same productivity class (out of 5). Finally, field-obtained estimates of slope and aspect were compared with GIS-derived estimates from precisely-located plots to assess their level of agreement. Correlations between field-measured and GIS-derived values were r = 0.6 for slope and r = 0.4 for aspect. Results of these experiments indicate that perturbed plot locations may not be suitable for such fine-scale applications.},

  abstract = {Average Customer Rating: 5.0 Rating: 4 Overall good, but could be less technical I was really excited when I ordered this book as it looked like the type of material I had been looking for for ages, but as it turns out I am mildly disappointed in it, primarily because I found the text somewhat hard to grasp and the code not particularly well explained. It is still a very good read though and certainly helped me enhance my knowledge of statistical analyses in R. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to examine spatial data in R, but there is a bit of homework to do to be able to understand how all the pieces fit together. Rating: 5 Just what is needed This book fills a gap in the Spatial Statistics literature. Most of the treatises are heavy on the math, and I find it difficult to bridge the gap between the formulas and applying them. The modules for R take care of this for you and leave you to interpret the result. This book covers most of these modules and demonstrates how to use them. Really worth getting. There is also the ESRI Guide to GIS Analysis Vol 2, but it is more of an introductory text. Rating: 5 Excelent Book! Do you know that felling you may have when you found exactly what you were looking for? Well, that was the felling I had when started to read this book. It brings detailed information about how you can and should use the spatial data analysis resources of R, with interactive examples and enlighten explanations. You will really understand what you are doing and will find ways to represent it the best way you could. Rating: 5 Lots of information, clearly presented. This is not a book for a beginner, but is an excellent book for two groups of readers: those who have some background with R and wish to learn about its capabilities for spatial statistics; and those with some background in spatial statistics who wish to learn how to use R. The authors have been the main developers of the spatial statistics packages on R, and therefore know the packages intimately. But the authors also have a deep knowledge of the spatial statistics literature, and I found myself learning something new about these methods in every chapter. Everyone serious about spatial statistics should see what R has to offer. This book is the easiest way to do that. Rating: 5 The best practial introduction to R spatial The R spatial packages are the leading edge for spatial analysis and spatial statistics. This book, by the primary developers of the R Spatial packages, is the best introduction to the subject that I have seen. Now, if you are comfortable with it, you can dive an and download R and R spatial and go to town. But if you need some help, this is a good place to start. This would also make a good textbook for a class on spatial analysis.},

  abstract = {Fire regimes result from reciprocal interactions between vegetation and fire that may be further affected by other disturbances, including climate, landform, and terrain. In this paper, we describe fire and fuel extensions for the forest landscape simulation model, LANDIS-II, that allow dynamic interactions among fire, vegetation, climate, and landscape structure, and incorporate realistic fire characteristics (shapes, distributions, and effects) that can vary within and between fire events. We demonstrate the capabilities of the new extensions using two case study examples with very different ecosystem characteristics: a boreal forest system from central Labrador, Canada, and a mixed conifer system from the Sierra Nevada Mountains (California, USA). In Labrador, comparison between the more complex dynamic fire extension and a classic fire simulator based on a simple fire size distribution showed little difference in terms of mean fire rotation and potential severity, but cumulative burn patterns created by the dynamic fire extension were more heterogeneous due to feedback between fuel types and fire behavior. Simulations in the Sierra Nevada indicated that burn patterns were responsive to topographic features, fuel types, and an extreme weather scenario, although the magnitude of responses depended on elevation. In both study areas, simulated fire size and resulting fire rotation intervals were moderately sensitive to parameters controlling the curvilinear response between fire spread and weather, as well as to the assumptions underlying the correlation between weather conditions and fire duration. Potential fire severity was more variable within the Sierra Nevada landscape and also was more sensitive to the correlation between weather conditions and fire duration. The fire modeling approach described here should be applicable to questions related to climate change and disturbance interactions, particularly within locations characterized by steep topography, where temporally or spatially dynamic vegetation significantly influences spread rates, where fire severity is variable, and where multiple disturbance types of varying severities are common.},

  volume = {96},
  abstract = {Depending on how disease impacts tree exposure to risk, both the prevalence of disease and disease effects on survival may contribute to patterns of mortality risk across a species' range. Disease may accelerate tree species' declines in response to global change factors, such as drought, biotic interactions, such as competition, or functional traits, such as allometry. To assess the role of disease in mediating mortality risk in quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides), we developed hierarchical Bayesian models for both disease prevalence in live aspen stems and the resulting survival rates of healthy and diseased aspen near the species' southern range limit using 5088 individual trees on 281 United States Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis plots in the southwestern United States. We found that disease prevalence depended primarily on tree size, tree allometry, and spatial variation in precipitation, while mortality depended on tree size, allometry, competition, spatial variation in summer temperature, and both temporal and spatial variation in summer precipitation. Disease prevalence was highest in large trees with low slenderness found on dry sites. For healthy trees, mortality decreased with diameter, slenderness, and temporal variation in summer precipitation, but increased with competition and spatial variation in summer temperature. Mortality of diseased trees decreased with diameter and aspen relative basal area and increased with mean summer temperature and precipitation. Disease infection increased aspen mortality, especially in trees of intermediate size and trees on plots at climatic extremes (i.e., cool, wet and warm, dry climates). By examining variation in disease prevalence, mortality of healthy trees, and mortality of diseased trees, we showed that the role of disease in aspen tree mortality depended on the scale of inference. For variation among individuals in diameter, disease tended to expose intermediate-size trees experiencing moderate risk to greater risk. For spatial variation in summer temperature, disease exposed lower risk populations to greater mortality probabil- ities, but the magnitude of this exposure depended on summer precipitation. Furthermore, the importance of diameter and slenderness in mediating responses to climate supports the increasing emphasis on trait variation in studies of ecological responses to global change.},

This study utilizes and expands on a conceptual approach for understanding adaptive capacity to wildfire in a comparison of 18 past case studies. The intent is to determine whether comparison of local social context and community characteristics across cases can identify community ``archetypes'' that approach wildfire planning and mitigation in consistently different ways. Identification of community archetypes serves as a potential strategy for collaborating with diverse populations at risk from wildfire and designing tailored messages related to wildfire risk mitigation. Our analysis uncovered four consistent community archetypes that differ in terms of the local social context and community characteristics that continue to influence response to wildfire risk. Differences among community archetypes include local communication networks, reasons for place attachment or community identity, distrust of government, and actions undertaken to address issues of forest health and esthetics. Results indicate that the methodological approach advanced in this study can be used to draw more consistent lessons across case studies and provide the means to test different communication strategies among archetypes.},

Complex relationships between host plant, pest, pathogen and environment create uncertainty particularly involving vector-borne diseases. We attempt to improve the understanding of the effects of climate change via a detailed review of one crop-vector-pathogen system. The bird cherry-oat aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi, is a global pest of cereals and vector of yellow dwarf viruses that cause significant crop losses in cereals. R. padi exhibits both sexual and parthenogenetic reproduction, alternating between crops and other host plants. In Australia, only parthenogenesis occurs due to the absence of the primary host, thus the aphid continuously cycles from grasses to cereals, allowing for continuous virus acquisition and transmission. We have reviewed the potential impact of future climate projections on R. padi population dynamics, persistence, abundance, dispersal and migration events as well as the interactions between vector, virus, crop and environment, all of which are critical to the behaviour and development of the vector and its ability to transmit the virus. We identify a number of knowledge gaps that currently limit efforts to determine how this pathosystem will function in a future climate. ?? 2011.},

The environmentally sensitive fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), which causes the amphibian disease chytridiomycosis, has spread globally causing amphibian extirpations in a wide variety of climatic regions. To gain an in-depth understanding of Bd's responses to temperature, we used an integrative approach, combining empirical laboratory experiments with mathematical modeling. First, we selected a single Bd isolate and serially propagated two lineages of the isolate for multiple generations in two stable thermal conditions: 4$^\circ$C (cold-adapted lineage) and 23$^\circ$C (warm-adapted lineage). We quantified the production of infectious zoospores (fecundity), the timing of zoospore release, and zoospore activity in reciprocal temperature transplant experiments in which both Bd lineages were grown in either high or low temperature conditions. We then developed population growth models for the Bd lineages under each set of temperature conditions. We found that Bd had lower population growth rates, but longer periods of zoospore activity in the low temperature treatment (4$^\circ$C) compared to the high temperature treatment (23$^\circ$C). This effect was more pronounced in Bd lineages that were propagated in the low temperature treatment (4$^\circ$C), suggesting a shift in Bd's response to low temperature conditions. Our results provide novel insights into the mechanisms by which Bd can thrive in a wide variety of temperature conditions, potentially altering the dynamics of chytridiomycosis and thus, the propensity for Bd to cause amphibian population collapse. We also suggest that the adaptive responses of Bd to thermal conditions warrant further investigation, especially in the face of global climate change.},

  abstract = {Climate change may impact patterns of plant diseases and arthropod development in more complex ways than expected. In fact, whereas both crops and crop pathogens and pests are affected by climatic variables, they might be influenced by different combinations of driving factors, and they might respond to their change at different rates. In order to separate these effects, we need to improve our understanding of the host-pest/pathogen system, and consider their interaction. The aim of this study was to refine current assessments of climate change impacts on pest and disease pressure on grapevines by considering pest/pathogen-host interactions. This research (i) combined detailed phenological models of grapevine with phenological models of one of its key insect pests (European grapevine moth) and one of its key pathogens (powdery mildew), (ii) applied the models to climate change scenarios for a selected study area in the eastern Italian Alps, and (iii) considered potential changes in their interactions. These simulations suggest that in the warmer, more profitable viticultural areas of the study region increasing temperature might have a detrimental impact on crop yield due to increased asynchrony between the larvae-resistant growth stages of grapevine and larvae of the European grapevine moth. On the other hand, the increase in pest pressure due to the increased number of generations might not be as severe as expected on the basis of the pest model only, due to the advance in harvest dates limiting damages from late-season generations. Simulations for powdery mildew highlighted a decrease in simulated disease severity, especially in years with a later onset of the disease symptoms and in the climate scenario with higher temperature increases. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Developing such a model requires a prior knowledge of the fungus's response to the environmental conditions, which will be affected by pest management. In this work, we first measured the response of the fungus to the main physical environmental factors controlling its development, namely temperature (ranging from 18 $^\circ$C to 36 $^\circ$C) and wetness duration (from 2 h to 72 h). As response variables, we measured the percentage of formed appressoria (relative to the total number of spores), the length of the latent period (time lag between inoculation and first symptoms observed), and the rate of necrotic lesion extension (percentage of diseased leaf surface at different time steps). These variables allow us to estimate the effects of temperature and wetness duration on the success of infection (appressoria formation) and the subsequent rate of disease development (latent period length and lesion extension rate). The data were fitted to non-linear models chosen for their ability to describe the observed patterns. From our data and model analyses, we were able to estimate parameters such as the optimal and maximal temperatures (25\textendash{}28 $^\circ$C and 36 $^\circ$C, respectively), the required wetness duration to reach 20 \% of infection success and the time to reach 5 \% disease severity as a function of temperature.},

Firstly, it forecasts disease severity (percentage of host tissue infected) by incorporating effects on disease development of the amount of healthy susceptible tissue and current infectious (sporulating) disease, the level of initial inoculum (overwintered 'primary' mildew) and weather conditions. The effects of weather variables are considered on only two aspects of the fungal life cycle: initial spore germination and the subsequent development during the incubation period. Secondly, the model generates indices of the relative favourability of weather conditions on disease development by incorporating effects of weather on conidial production/dispersal and germination. On each day, forecasts of the (relative) severity of new infection and total current infectious disease are given for both types of output. The model was evaluated by comparing its predictions with the mildew epidemics observed in two unsprayed orchards over four years. In all the years, the temporal patterns of the predicted and the observed disease were generally similar. The pattern of the disease severity forecasts was marginally closer to the observed than that derived from two weather indices.

Rising carbon dioxide and temperature and altered precipitation modifies plant growth and development with concomitant changes in canopy architecture, size, density, microclimate and the quantity of susceptible tissue. The modified host physiology and canopy microclimate at elevated carbon dioxide influences production, dispersal and survival of pathogen inoculum and feeding behaviour of insect pests. Elevated temperature accelerates plant growth and developmental rates to modify canopy architecture and pest and pathogen development. Altered precipitation affects canopy architecture through either drought or flooding stress with corresponding effects on pests and pathogens. But canopy-level interactions are largely ignored in epidemiology models used to project climate change impacts. Nevertheless, models based on rules of plant morphogenesis have been used to explore pest and pathogen dynamics and their trophic interactions under elevated carbon dioxide. The prospect of modifying canopy architecture for pest and disease management has also been raised. We offer a conceptual framework incorporating canopy characteristics in the traditional disease triangle concept to advance understanding of host-pathogen-environment interactions and explore how climate change may influence these interactions. From a review of recent literature we summarize interrelationships between canopy architecture of cultivated crops, pest and pathogen biology and climate change under four areas of research: (a) relationships between canopy architecture, microclimate and host-pathogen interaction; (b) effect of climate change related variables on canopy architecture; (c) development of pests and pathogens in modified canopy under climate change; and (d) pests and pathogen management under climate change.},

One of the important objectives in epidemiology is to understand such spatio-temporal dynamics via mathematical and statistical modelling. In this paper, we outline common methodologies that are used to quantify and model spatio-temporal dynamics of plant diseases, with emphasis on developing temporal forecast models and on quantifying spatial patterns. Several examples of epidemiological models in cereal crops are described, including one for Fusarium head blight.},

  abstract = {The main entomological parameters involved in the rate of dengue virus transmission include the longevity of female mosquitoes, the time interval between bites and the extrinsic incubation period of the virus. Field and laboratory data provide estimates for these parameters, but their interactions with other factors (e.g. host population density and environmental parameters) make their integration into a transmission model quite complex. To estimate the impact of these parameters on transmission, we developed a model of virus transmission by a vector population which predicts the number of potentially infective bites under a range of temperatures and entomological parameters, including the daily survival rate of females, the interval between bites and the extrinsic incubation period. Results show that in a stable population, an increase in mosquito longevity disproportionately enhances the number of potential transmissions (e.g. by as much as five times when the survival rate rises from 0.80 to 0.95). Halving the length of the biting interval with a 10- degrees C rise in temperature increases the transmission rate by at least 2.4 times. Accordingly, the model can predict changes in dengue transmission associated with short-term variation in seasonal temperature and also with potentially long-lasting increases in global temperatures.},

  abstract = {Abstract Predicting the population dynamics of insects in natural conditions is essential for their management or preservation, and temperature-dependent development models contribute to achieving this. In this research the effects of temperature and soil moisture content on egg development and hatching of Clavipalpus ursinus (Blanchard) were evaluated. The eggs were exposed to seven temperature treatments with averages of 7.2, 13.0, 15.5, 19.7, 20.6, 22.0 and 25.3$^\circ$C, in combination with three soil moisture contents of 40\%, 60\% and 80\%. A linear and two non-linear (Lactin and Briere) models were evaluated in order to determine the thermal requirements of this developmental stage. Temperature affected significantly the time of development and egg hatching, while no significant effect was observed for moisture content. Thermal requirements were set as: 7.2$^\circ$C for lower developmental threshold, 20.6$^\circ$C for optimum developmental threshold, 25.3$^\circ$C for maximum temperature and 344.83 degree-days for the thermal constant. The linear model described satisfactorily egg development at intermediate temperatures; nevertheless, a slightly better fit of the observed data was obtained with the Lactin model. Egg development took place inside a narrow range of temperatures. Consequently, an increment of soil temperature could generate a negative impact on the population size of this species or changes in its biological parameters.},

We present a global analysis of pest and pathogen distributions, to determine the roles of socioeconomic and biophysical factors in determining pest diversity, controlling for variation in observational capacity among countries. Known distributions of 1901 pests and pathogens were obtained from CABI. Linear models were used to partition the variation in pest species per country amongst predictors. Reported pest numbers increased with per capita gross domestic product (GDP), research expenditure and research capacity, and the influence of economics was greater in micro-organisms than in arthropods. Total crop production and crop diversity were the strongest physical predictors of pest numbers per country, but trade and tourism were insignificant once other factors were controlled. Islands reported more pests than mainland countries, but no latitudinal gradient in species richness was evident. Country wealth is likely to be a strong indicator of observational capacity, not just trade flow, as has been interpreted in invasive species studies. If every country had US levels of per capita GDP, then 205 $\pm$ 9 additional pests per country would be reported, suggesting that enhanced investment in pest observations will reveal the hidden threat of crop pests and pathogens.},

  abstract = {To explore the potential role of ambient temperature on infection transmission dynamics for pathogens, we used Escherichia coli O157:H7 in a dairy herd and the surrounding farm environment as a model system. For this system, we developed a mathematical model in which a Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS) model of infection spread through the host population is coupled with a metapopulation model of E. coli O157:H7 free-living stage in the environment allowing bacterial growth to be influenced by ambient temperature. Model results indicate that seasonal variation in ambient temperature could have a considerable impact on pathogen populations in the environment, specifically on barn surfaces and in water troughs, and consequently on the prevalence of infection in the host population. Based on model assumptions, contaminated drinking water was the most important pathway of E. coli O157:H7 transmission to cattle. Sensitivity analysis indicated that water-borne transmission is amplified during the warmer months if the amount of standing drinking water available to the cattle herd is high. This is because warmer ambient temperature favors faster pathogen replication which when combined with slower water replacement-rate due to high amount of available standing water leads to a greater pathogen load in drinking water. These results offer a possible explanation of the seasonal variation in E. coli O157:H7 prevalence in cattle and suggest that improved drinking-water management could be used for control of this infection in cattle. Our study demonstrates how consideration of ambient temperature in transmission cycles of pathogens able to survive and grow in the environment outside the host could offer novel perspectives on the spread and control of infections caused by such pathogens. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Here, we demonstrate an average poleward shift of 2.7$\pm$0.8 km yr-1 since 1960, in observations of hundreds of pests and pathogens, but with significant variation in trends among taxonomic groups. Observational bias, where developed countries at high latitudes detect pests earlier than developing countries at low latitudes, would result in an apparent shift towards the Equator. The observed positive latitudinal trends in many taxa support the hypothesis of global warming-driven pest movement.},

The diversity of pathogens on highly abundant introduced hosts has been positively correlated with time since introduction, geographical range of the introduced species and diversity of invaded habitats. However, little is known about the ecological effects of pathogen accumulation on non- native invasive plants. 2. Pathogen accumulation on invasive plant species may result from ecological processes such as high plant densities, expanding geographical ranges and pathogen dispersal from the native range, or evolutionary mechanisms such as host range shifts and adaptation of native pathogens to invasive species. 3. Over time pathogen accumulation may cause decline in the density and distribution of invasive plants and facilitate recovery of native species. Alternatively, pathogens might build up on invasive species and then spill back onto co-occurring native species, further exacerbating the effects of inva- sions. 4. Synthesis. Research efforts should focus on determining the long-term outcomes of pathogen accumulation on invasive species. Such research will require multifaceted approaches including com- parative studies of diverse invasive species and habitats, experimental manipulations of hosts and pathogens in nature and controlled environments, and predictive models of host-pathogen interac- tions within an invasion framework. Results of this research will improve our understanding and ability to predict the outcomes of biological invasions.},

  abstract = {Using daily observations of temperature, precipitation, radiation, and humidity from 24 stations spanning a large elevation gradient in Austria, we tested several previously defined algorithms for estimating daily radiation and humidity. The estimation algorithms were first tested independently, and then combined, resulting in a combined algorithm for estimating both radiation and humidity that relies only on temperature and precipitation inputs. Mean absolute errors (MAE) for joint radiation and humidity estimates were 2.52 MJ m -2 per day and 85.6 Pa, respectively, close to values reported for the algorithm development studies. Biases were low: +0.02 MJ m -2 per day and +28.2 Pa for radiation and humidity, respectively. Initial results showed biases in estimated radiation related to horizon obstruction and snowpack. We amended the original algorithm, successfully eliminating these effects. Annual prediction MAE was weakly correlated with elevation, and annual bias was not correlated with elevation. Analysis of seasonal patterns in error-elevation relationships showed several periods with significant trends. Radiation MAE was slightly higher in mid-summer for higher elevations, and radiation biases were in general closer to zero throughout the spring and summer at higher elevations. Humidity estimates showed an increased MAE and positive bias at higher elevations in winter. We concluded that the effect of different temperature lapse rates for daily maximum and minimum temperature on the relationship between diurnal temperature range and atmospheric transmittance does not seriously impair predictions over steep elevation gradients in complex terrain.

This method is unreliable under arid conditions where nightly minimum temperatures may remain well above the dew point. Daily meteorological data from 52 weather stations within the continental US and Alaska were evaluated. Daily differences between T(d,day) and T(n) were large in and climates with corresponding vapor pressure differences averaging between 0.8 and 1.2 kPa on an annual basis. Sites with semi-and characteristics showed a large degree of seasonality in the results with average vapor pressure differences ranging from 0.1 to 0.6 kPa between winter and summer months. Sites in other climate regimes generally showed small differences between T(n) and T(d,day) over the entire year, corresponding to average vapor pressure differences of less than 0.3 kPa. An empirical model was developed to improve the accuracy of T(n) based humidity estimates using daily air temperature, annual precipitation and estimated daily potential evapotranspiration. The model reduced humidity estimation errors by up to 80\% at semi-arid and arid sites and had minimal effects when T(n) based humidity estimates, were relatively accurate. The ratio of annual precipitation to estimated annual evapotranspiration was useful for distinguishing sites where T(n) based humidity estimates were relatively accurate from sites where estimation errors were large. The results of this investigation provide a simple, mere accurate method than T(n) for estimating humidity in arid and semi-arid regions using general weather station data.},

  abstract = {We present a reformulation of the Bristow$\pm$Campbell model for daily solar radiation, developed using daily observations of radiation, temperature, humidity, and precipitation, from 40 stations in contrasting climates. By expanding the original model to include a spatially and temporally variable estimate of clear-sky transmittance, and applying a small number of other minor modi\textregistered{}cations, the new model produces better results than the original over a wider range of climates. Our method does not require reparameterization on a site-by-site basis, a distinct advantage over the original approach. We do require observations of dewpoint temperature, which the original model does not, but we suggest a method that could eliminate this dependency. Mean absolute error (MAE) for predictions of clear-sky transmittance was improved by 28\% compared to the original model formulation. Aerosols and snowcover probably contribute to variation in clear-sky transmittance that remains unexplained by our method. MAE and bias for prediction of daily incident radiation were about 2.4 MJ m \"y2 day \"y1 and 0.5 MJ m \"y2 day \"y1, respectively. As a percent of the average observed values of incident radiation, MAE and bias are about 15\% and 4\%, respectively. The lowest errors and smallest biases (percent basis) occurred during the summer. The highest prediction biases were associated with stations having a strong seasonal concentration of precipitation, with underpredictions at summerprecipitation stations, and overpredictions at winter-precipitation stations. Further study is required to characterize the behavior of this method for tropical climates.},

  abstract = {Under the theory of independent and identically distributed random cascades, the probability distribution of the cascade generator determines the spatial and the ensemble properties of spatial rainfall. Three sets of radar-derived rainfall data in space and time are analyzed to estimate the probability distribution of the generator. A detailed comparison between instantaneous scans of spatial rainfall and simulated cascades using the scaling properties of the marginal moments is carried out. This comparison highlights important similarities and differences between the data and the random cascade theory. Differences are quantified and measured for the three datasets. Evidence is presented to show that the scaling properties of the rainfall can be captured to the first order by a random cascade with a single parameter. The dependence of this parameter on forcing by the large-scale meteorological conditions, as measured by the large-scale spatial average rain rate, is investigated for these three datasets. The data show that this dependence can be captured by a one-to-one function. Since the large-scale average rain rate can be diagnosed from the large-scale dynamics, this relationship demonstrates an important linkage between the large-scale atmospheric dynamics and the statistical cascade theory of mesoscale rainfall. Potential application of this research to parameterization of runoff from the land surface and regional flood frequency analysis is briefly discussed, and open problems for further research are presented.},

  abstract = {In his classic study in the Siskiyou Mountains (Oregon, USA), one of the most botanically rich forested regions in North America, R. H. Whittaker (1960) foreshadowed many modern ideas on the multivariate control of local species richness along environmental gradients related to productivity. Using a structural equation model to analyze his data, which were never previously statistically analyzed, we demonstrate that Whittaker was remarkably accurate in concluding that local herb richness in these late-seral forests is explained to a large extent by three major abiotic gradients (soils, topography, and elevation), and in turn, by the effects of these gradients on tree densities and the numbers of individual herbs. However, while Whittaker also clearly appreciated the significance of large-scale evolutionary and biogeographic influences on community composition, he did not fully articulate the more recent concept that variation in the species richness of local communities could be explained in part by variation in the sizes of regional species pools. Our model of his data is among the first to use estimates of regional species pool size to explain variation in local community richness along productivity-related gradients. We find that regional pool size, combined with a modest number of other interacting abiotic and biotic factors, explains most of the variation in local herb richness in the Siskiyou biodiversity hotspot.},

  abstract = {The global focus on wildlife as a major contributor to emerging pathogens and infectious diseases (EIDs) in humans and domestic animals is not based on field, experimental or dedicated research, but mostly on limited surveys of literature, opinion and the assumption that biodiversity harbours pathogens. The perceived and direct impacts of wildlife, from being a reservoir of certain human and livestock pathogens and as a risk to health, are frequently overstated when compared to the Global burden of disease statistics available from WHO, OIE and FAO. However organisms that evolve in wildlife species can and do spill-over into human landscapes and humans and domestic animal population and, where these organisms adapt to surviving and spreading amongst livestock and humans, these emerging infections can have significant consequences. Drivers for the spill-over of pathogens or evolution of organisms from wildlife reservoirs to become pathogens of humans and domestic animals are varied but almost without exception poorly researched. The changing demographics, spatial distribution and movements, associated landscape modifications (especially agricultural) and behavioural changes involving human and domestic animal populations are probably the core drivers of the apparent increasing trend in emergence of new pathogens and infectious diseases over recent decades.},

There seems to be a wide spread view that we need to do something to address this problem, as it is essential to the advancement of our field. The most compelling argument would seem to be that reproducibility of experimental results is the hallmark of science. Therefore, given that most of us regard machine learning as a scientific discipline, being able to replicate experiments is paramount. I want to challenge this view by separating the notion of reproducibility, a generally desirable property, from replicability, its poor cousin. I claim there are important differences between the two. Reproducibility requires changes; replicability avoids them. Although reproducibility is desirable, I contend that the impoverished version, replicability, is one not worth having.},

The spatially defined focus, or nidus, of transmission may be characterized by vegetation as well as by climate, latitude, elevation, and geology. The ecological complexity, dimensions, and temporal stability of the nidus are determined largely by pathogen natural history and vector bionomics. Host populations, transmission efficiency, and therefore pathogen amplification vary spatially, thereby creating a heterogeneous surface that may be defined by remote sensing and statistical tools. The current review describes the evolution of landscape epidemiology as a science and exemplifies selected aspects by contrasting the ecology of two different recent disease outbreaks in North America caused by West Nile virus, an explosive, highly virulent mosquito-borne virus producing ephemeral nidi, and Borrelia burgdorferi, a slowly amplifying chronic pathogen producing semipermanent nidi.},

  abstract = {Climate change is real. The wrangling debates are over, and we now need to move onto a predictive ecology that will allow managers of landscapes and policy makers to adapt to the likely changes in biodiversity over the coming decades. There is ample evidence that ecological responses are already occurring at the individual species (population) level. The challenge is how to synthesize the growing list of such observations with a coherent body of theory that will enable us to predict where and when changes will occur, what the consequences might be for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and what we might do practically in order to maintain those systems in as good condition as possible. It is thus necessary to investigate the effects of climate change at the ecosystem level and to consider novel emergent ecosystems composed of new species assemblages arising from differential rates of range shifts of species. Here, we present current knowledge on the effects of climate change on biotic interactions and ecosystem services supply, and summarize the papers included in this volume. We discuss how resilient ecosystems are in the face of the multiple components that characterize climate change, and suggest which current ecological theories may be used as a starting point to predict ecosystem-level effects of climate change.},

  abstract = {This paper is concerned with mapping monthly precipitation in Great Britain from sparse point data using a range of interpolation methods. The paper applies techniques that make use of the relation between precipitation and secondary variables, such as elevation, and the concern is to assess if they provide more accurate estimates than methods that do not make use of such secondary variables. The techniques applied were: (i) moving window regression (MWR), (ii) inverse distance weighting (IDW); (iii) ordinary kriging (OK), (iv) simple kriging with a locally varying mean (SKlm) and (v) kriging with an external drift (KED). MWR, SKlm and KED make use of secondary information and in this paper elevation data were acquired to inform estimation of precipitation using these techniques. The relationship between precipitation and elevation locally, and its effect on the accuracy of estimates, was examined for each month of 1999. The performance of each interpolation method was assessed through examination of mapped estimates of precipitation and cross-validation. It was concluded that KED provides the most accurate estimates of precipitation for all months from March to December judging by the cross-validation estimation error summary statistics whereas for January and February OK provided the most accurate estimates. \textcopyright{} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

By contrast, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) have been reported to promote seedling performance; however, it is unknown whether this is also distance dependent. Here, we investigate the distance dependence of seedling performance in the presence of both pathogens and AMF. In a subtropical forest in south China, we conducted a four-year field census of four species with relatively large phylogenetic distances and found no distance-dependent mortality for newly germinated seedlings. By experimentally separating the effects of AMF and pathogens on seedling performance of six subtropical tree species in a shade house, we found that soil pathogens significantly inhibited seedling survival and growth while AMF largely promoted seedling growth, and these effects were host specific and declined wit...},

Here, using data from 134 permanent sample plots from 60 to 68$^\circ$ N, we show that boreal forest plant communities in Northwestern Canada increase in richness towards the poles, despite a strong increase in climatic harshness. We hypothesized three possible explanations for this pattern: 1) historical biogeography, 2) reduced competition for light at high latitudes (biotic interactions), and 3) changes in soil characteristics with latitude. We used multidimensional scaling to investigate the community composition at each site and found no clustering of communities by latitude, suggesting that historical biogeography was not constraining site diversity. We then investigated the mechanisms behind this gradient using both abiotic (climate and soil) and biot...},

  issn = {1365-2486},
  doi = {10.1111/gcb.12915},
  abstract = {Natural forest growth and expansion are important carbon sequestration processes globally. Climate change is likely to increase forest growth in some regions via CO2 fertilization, increased temperatures, and altered precipitation, however altered disturbance regimes and climate stress (e.g., drought) will act to reduce carbon stocks in forests as well. Observations of asynchrony in forest change is useful in determining current trends in forest carbon stocks, both in terms of forest density (e.g., Mg/ha carbon) and spatially (extent and location). Monitoring change in natural (unmanaged) areas is particularly useful, as while afforestation and recovery from historical land use are currently large carbon sinks, the long-term viability of those sinks depends on climate change and disturbance dynamics at their particular location. We utilize a large, unmanaged biome (135,000 km(2) ) which spans a broad latitudinal gradient to explore how variation in location affects forest density and spatial patterning: the forests of the North American temperate rainforests in Alaska, which store 2.8 Pg C in biomass and soil, equivalent to 8\% of the C in contiguous US forests. We demonstrate that the regional biome is shifting; gains exceed losses and are located in different spatio-topographic contexts. Forest gains are concentrated on northerly aspects, lower elevations, and higher latitudes, especially in sheltered areas, whereas loss is skewed towards southerly aspects and lower latitudes. Repeat plot-scale biomass data (n= 759) indicates that within-forest biomass gains outpace losses (live trees 12.7 cm diameter, 986 Gg year(-1) ) on gentler slopes and in higher latitudes. This work demonstrates that while temperate rainforest dynamics occur at fine spatial scales (less than 1000 m(2) ); the net result of thousands of individual events is regionally patterned change. Correlations between the disturbance/establishment imbalance and biomass accumulation suggest the potential for relatively rapid biome shifts and biomass changes.

  abstract = {Plant species introduced into new regions can both leave behind co-evolved pathogens and acquire new ones. Traits important to infection and virulence are subject to rapid evolutionary change in both plant and pathogen. Using Stemphylium solani, a native foliar necrotroph on clovers ( Trifolium and Medicago) in California, USA, we explore how plant-fungal interactions may change in an invasion context. After four generations of experimental serial passage through multiple hosts, Stemphylium consistently showed increased infection rates but no consistent change in damage to the host. In a historical opportunity study, we compared infection and virulence across four groups of clover hosts: California natives, European clovers not found in California, and both California and European genotypes of species naturalized in California. There was significant variation among hosts, but no pattern across the four groups. However, in direct comparisons of familiar California genotypes to unfamiliar European genotypes of the same naturalized species, Stemphylium consistently infected familiar hosts more frequently, while causing less damage on them. This pattern is consistent with the hypothesis of adaptive evolution in both the pathogen (ability to infect) and the host (tolerance of infection). Together these results suggest the potential for rapid evolution to alter interactions between plant invaders and their natural enemies.

  abstract = {1.Host-parasite interactions have the potential to influence broad scale ecological and evolutionary processes, levels of endemism, divergence patterns and distributions in host populations. Understanding the mechanisms involved requires identification of the factors that shape parasite distribution and prevalence. 2.A lack of comparative information on community-level host-parasite associations limits our understanding of the role of parasites in host population divergence processes. Avian malaria (haemosporodian) parasites in bird communities offer a tractable model system to examine the potential for pathogens to influence evolutionary processes in natural host populations. 3.Using cytochrome b variation, we characterized phylogenetic diversity and prevalence of two genera of avian haemosporidian parasites, Plasmodium and Haemoproteus, and analysed biogeographic patterns of lineages across islands and avian hosts, in southern Melanesian bird communities to identify factors that explain patterns of infection. 4.Plasmodium spp. displayed isolation by distance effects, a significant amount of genetic variation distributed among islands but insignificant amounts among host species and families, and strong local island effects with respect to prevalence. Haemoproteus spp. did not display isolation by distance patterns, showed significant structuring of genetic variation among avian host species and families, and significant host species prevalence patterns. 5.These differences suggest that Plasmodium spp. infection patterns were shaped by geography and the abiotic environment, whereas Haemoproteus spp. infection patterns were shaped predominantly by host associations. Heterogeneity in the complement and prevalence of parasite lineages infecting local bird communities likely exposes host species to a mosaic of spatially divergent disease selection pressures across their naturally fragmented distributions in southern Melanesia. Host associations for Haemoproteus spp. indicate a capacity for the formation of locally co-adapted host-parasite relationships, a feature that may limit intraspecific gene flow or range expansions of closely related host species.

However, existing reserves and national parks are unlikely to incorporate the long-term and large-scale dynamics of ecosystems. Hence, conservation strategies have to actively incorporate the large areas of land that are managed for human use. For ecosystems to reorganize after large-scale natural and human-induced disturbances, spatial resilience in the form of ecological memory is a prerequisite. The ecological memory is composed of the species, interactions and structures that make ecosystem reorganization possible, and its components may be found within disturbed patches as well in the surrounding landscape. Present static reserves should be complemented with dynamic reserves, such as ecological fallows and dynamic successional reserves, that are part of ecosystem management mimicking natural disturbance regimes at the landscape level.},

We extend the microclimate model of the software package niche mapper to capture spatial and temporal variation in soil thermal properties and integrate it with gridded soil and weather data for Australia at 0\textperiodcentered{}05$^\circ$ resolution. When tested against historical observations of soil temperature, the microclimate model predicted 85\% of the variation in hourly soil temperature across 10 years from the surface to 1 m deep with an accuracy of 2\textendash{}3\textperiodcentered{}3 $^\circ$C (c. 10\% of the temperature range at a given depth) across an extremely climatically diverse range of sites. This capacity to accurately and mechanistically predict hourly local microclimates across continental scales creates new opportunities for understanding how organisms respond to changes in climate.},

  doi = {10.1023/A:1011112719782},
  abstract = {The ecological interpretation of landscape patterns is one of the major objectives in landscape ecology. Both landscape patterns and ecological processes need to be quantified before statistical relationships between these variables can be examined. Landscape indices provide quantitative information about landscape pattern. Response variables or process rates quantify the outcome of ecological processes (e.g., dispersal success for landscape connectivity or Morisita's index for the spatial distribution of individuals). While the principal potential of this approach has been demonstrated in several studies, the robustness of the statistical relationships against variations in landscape structure or against variations of the ecological process itself has never been explicitly investigated. This paper investigates the consistency of correlations between a set of landscape indices (calculated with Fragstats) and three response variables from a simulated dispersal process across heterogeneous landscapes (cell immigration, dispersal success and search time) against variation in three experimental treatments (control variables): habitat amount, habitat fragmentation and dispersal behavior. I found strong correlations between some landscape indices and all three response variables. However, 68\% of the statistical relationships were highly inconsistent and sometimes ambiguous for different landscape structures and for differences in dispersal behavior. Correlations between one landscape index and one response variable could range from highly positive to highly negative when derived from different spatial patterns. I furthermore compared correlation coefficients obtained from artificially generated (neutral) landscape models with those obtained from Landsat TM images. Both landscape representations produced equally strong and weak statistical relationships between landscape indices and response variables. This result supports the use of neutral landscape models in theoretical analyses of pattern-process relationships.},

In this review, we discuss spatial patterns and effects of N deposition and tropospheric O3 on net greenhouse-gas fluxes in North American forest and grassland ecosystems. While projected rates of ammonia emissions and deposition are expected to remain unchanged, projected declines in nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions within the US will likely lead to reductions in total N deposition and O3. The net effect of these changes in N deposition onto forests and grasslands will likely initiate declines in C sequestration attributed to N deposition over the next 40 years.},

We test this hypothesis using a large dataset of bumblebee occurrence records and agricultural census data. We find support for the pathogen spillover hypothesis for two species but no evidence that pathogen spillover caused the near disappearance of the previously widespread Bombus affinis. Furthermore, we show that pesticide use and habitat loss are unlikely to be major causes of decline for any of the Bombus species examined. Collectively, our analyses underscore that there remains an urgent need to identify causes of pollinator population losses.},

  abstract = {Macroecology proceeds by identifying patterns and then identifying processes that cause those patterns. Most of the processes that macroecologists study are local in nature and tend to involve species interactions and speciation and extinction processes. In contrast, we propose that several important macroecological patterns can be explained by very large-scale processes that are primarily spatial in nature. Specifically, we suggest that the structure of abundance across a species' entire range combined with interspecific patterns in range location and global abundance can explain the well-known macroecological patterns of: (1) a positive correlation between range size and abundance, (2) the species-area relationship, (3) decay of species similarity with distance and (4) the species abundance distribution. We show that spatial processes produce these patterns through a combination of analytical and Monte Carlo analysis. We also show that the connection is robust (indifferent) to the precise mathematical assumptions. Such a theory might be called a unified theory, because it explains multiple patterns with a few processes. To differentiate among the growing number of unified theories, we suggest that testing additional predictions over and above producing curves of the correct shape is important. To this end, we present several novel, quantitative predictions and provide empirical tests. In short, we provide an empirically grounded and tested theory, which suggests that superimposing individual species ranges across space creates local community patterns.},

At the time of the fires, little was known about the impacts of such a large severe disturbance because scientists had had few previous opportunities to study such an event. Ecologists predicted short- and long-term effects of the 1988 fires on vegetation, biogeochemistry, primary productivity, wildlife, and aquatic ecosystems based on scientific understanding of the time. Twenty-plus years of subsequent study allow these early predictions to be evaluated. Most of the original predictions were at least partially supported, but some predictions were refuted, others nuanced, and a few postfire phenomena were entirely unexpected. Post-1988 Yellowstone studies catalyzed advances in ecology focused on the importance of spatial and temporal heterogeneity, contingent influences, and multiple interacting drivers. Post-1988 research in Yellowstone also has changed public perceptions of fire as an ecological process and attitudes towards fire management. Looking ahead to projected climate change and more frequent large fires, the well-documented ecological responses to the 1988 Yellowstone fires provide a foundation for detecting and evaluating potential changes in fire regimes of temperate mountainous regions. \textcopyright{} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

  abstract = {Determining patterns of host use, and the frequency at which these patterns change, are of key importance if we are to understand tick population dynamics, the evolution of tick biodiversity, and the circulation and evolution of associated pathogens. The question of whether ticks are typically host specialists or host generalists has been subject to much debate over the last half-century. Indeed, early research proposed that morphological diversity in ticks was linked to host specific adaptations and that most ticks were specialists. Later work disputed this idea and suggested that ticks are largely limited by biogeographic conditions and tend to use all locally available host species. The work presented in this review suggests that the actual answer likely lies somewhere between these two extremes. Although recent observational studies support the view that phylogenetically diverse host species share ticks when found on similar ecological ranges, theory on host range evolution predicts that host specialization should evolve in ticks given their life history characteristics. Contemporary work employing population genetic tools to examine host-associated population structure in several tick systems support this prediction and show that simple species records are not enough to determine whether a parasite is a true host generalist; host specialization does evolve in ticks at local scales, but may not always lead to speciation. Ticks therefore seem to follow a pattern of being global generalists, local specialists. Given this, the notion of host range needs to be modified from an evolutionary perspective, where one simply counts the number of hosts used across the geographic distribution, to a more ecological view, where one considers host use at a local scale, if we are to better understand the circulation of tick-borne pathogens and exposure risks for humans and livestock.},

The carbon (C) sequestered in vegetated coastal ecosystems, specifically mangrove forests, seagrass beds, and salt marshes, has been termed ``blue carbon\{''\}. Although their global area is one to two orders of magnitude smaller than that of terrestrial forests, the contribution of vegetated coastal habitats per unit area to long-term C sequestration is much greater, in part because of their efficiency in trapping suspended matter and associated organic C during tidal inundation. Despite the value of mangrove forests, seagrass beds, and salt marshes in sequestering C, and the other goods and services they provide, these systems are being lost at critical rates and action is urgently needed to prevent further degradation and loss. Recognition of the C sequestration value of vegetated coastal ecosystems provides a strong argument for their protection and restoration; however, it is necessary to improve scientific understanding of the underlying mechanisms that control C sequestration in these ecosystems.

In Wisconsin, USA, Euro-American settlement in the mid- to late 1800s was accompanied by widespread logging, agricultural conversion, and fire suppression. To determine the maximum magnitude of change in forest ecosystems at the height of the agricultural period and the degree of recovery since that time, we assessed changes in forest species composition and structure among the (1) mid-1800s, at the onset of Euro-American settlement; (2) 1930s, at the height of the agricultural period; and (3) 2000s, following forest regrowth. Data sources included the original U.S. Public Land Survey records (mid-1800s), the Wisconsin Land Economic Inventory (1930s), and U.S. Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis data (2000s). We derived maps of relative species dominance and tree diameters for the three dates and assessed change using spatial error models, nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination, and S\o{}renson distance measures. Our results suggest that since the mid-1800s, hemlock and white pine have declined in absolute area from 22\% to 1\%, and the proportion of medium (25-50 cm) and large-diameter ( or = 50 cm) trees of all species has decreased from 71\% to 27\% across the entire state. Early-successional aspen-birch is three times more common than in the mid-1800s (9\% vs. 3\%), and maple and other shade-tolerant species are increasing in southern areas formerly dominated by oak forests and savannas. Since the peak agricultural extent in the 1930s, species composition and tree size in northern forests have shown some recovery, while southern forests appear to be on a novel trajectory of change. There is evidence of regional homogenization, but the broad north-south environmental gradient in Wisconsin constrains overall species composition. Although the nature of the future forests will be determined in part by climate change and other exogenous variables, land use is likely to remain the driving factor.},

However, after an initial period of high invasibility, growth of the resident community may lead to the monopolization of local resources and decreased probability of successful colonist establishment. During press disturbances (i.e., directional environmental change), it remains unclear what effect regional dispersal will have on local community structure if the establishment of later arriving species is affected by early arriving species (i.e., if priority effects are important). To determine the relationship between time-since-disturbance and invasibility, we conducted a fully factorial field mesocosm experiment that exposed tundra zooplankton communities to two emerging stressors - nutrient and salt addition, and manipulated the arrival timing of regional dispersers. Our results demonstrate that invasibility decreases with increasing time-since-disturbance as abundance (nutrient treatments) or species richness (salt treatments) increases in the resident community. Results suggest that the relative timing of dispersal and environmental change will modify the importance of priority effects in determining species composition after a press disturbance.},

  abstract = {As the world enters the Anthropocene \textendash{} a new geologic period, defined by humanity's massive impact on the planet \textendash{} the Earth's rapidly changing environment is putting critical ecosystem services at risk. To understand and forecast how ecosystems will change over the coming decades, scientists will require an understanding of the sensitivity of species to environmental change. The current distribution of species and functional groups provides valuable information about the performance of various species in different environments. However, when the rate of environmental change is high, information inherent in the ranges of many species will disappear, since that information exists only under more or less steady-state conditions. The amount of informa- tion about species' relationships to climate declines as their distributions move farther from steady state. New remote-sensing technologies can map the chemical and structural traits of plant canopies and will allow for the inference of traits and, in many cases, species' ranges. Current satellite remote-sensing data can only produce relatively simple classifications, but new techniques will produce data with dramatically higher biological information content. \textbullet{} The Earth's environments are changing faster than species' ranges can re-equilibrate to new environmental conditions, leading to growing inconsistencies between environmental conditions and ranges. \textbullet{} As species' distributions move away from steady state, information about their environmental niches from range\textendash{}environment correlations is lost. \textbullet{} New remote-sensing technologies deployed on airplanes and spacecraft can provide vast quantities of distributional data about vegetation and can be deployed quickly enough to observe species' range\textendash{}environment correlations before they are lost. \textbullet{} Next-generation remote sensing will allow us to identify species from observed canopy traits, opening up the possibility of global maps of plant species and traits at high resolution.},

The current regulation of plant imports is outdated and needs to balance the impacts of pest damage, the expense of mitigation efforts, and the benefits of live plant importation. To inform these discussions, we document large increases in the volume and value of plant imports over the past five decades and explain recent and proposed changes to plant import regulations. Two data sources were used to estimate the infestation rate of regulated pests in live plant shipments entering the US, thus allowing evaluation of the efficacy of the current port inspection process.},

  abstract = {We present an approach to modeling potential cli- mate-driven changes in habitat for tree and bird species in the eastern United States. First, we took an empirical-statistical modeling approach, using randomForest, with species abundance data from national inventories combined with soil, climate, and landscape variables, to build abundance-based habitat models for 134 tree and 147 bird species. We produced lists of species for which suitable habitat tends to increase, decrease, or stay the same for any region. Independent assessments of trends of large trees versus seedlings across the eastern U.S. show that 37 of 40 species in common under both studies are currently trending as modeled. We developed a framework, ModFacs, in which we used the literature to assign default modification factor scores for species characteristics that cannot be readily assessed in such models, including 12 disturbance factors (for example, drought, fire, insect pests), nine biological factors (for example, dispersal, shade tolerance), and assessment scores of novel climates, long-distance extrapolations, and output variability by climate model and emission scenario. We also used a spatially explicit cellular model, SHIFT, to calculate colonization potentials for some species, based on their abundance, historic dispersal distances, and the fragmented nature of the landscape. By combining results from the three efforts, we can create projections of potential cli- mate change impacts over the next 100 years or so. Here we emphasize some of the lessons we have learned over 16 years in hopes that they may help guide future experiments, modeling efforts, and management},

Hydrologic connectivity refers to the water-mediated transport of matter, energy, or organisms within or between elements of the hydrologic cycle. The potential negative consequences of enhancing hydrologic connectivity warrant careful consideration in human-modified landscapes that are increasingly characterized by hydrologic alteration, exotic species, high levels of nutrients and toxins, and disturbed sediment regimes. While connectivity is integral to the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems, it can also promote the distribution of undesirable components. Here we provide examples illustrating how reduced hydrologic connectivity can provide greater ecological benefits than enhanced connectivity does in highly developed, human-modified ecosystems; for example, in urban landscapes, "restoration" efforts can sometimes create population sinks for endangered biota. We conclude by emphasizing the importance of adaptive management and balancing trade-offs associated with further alterations of hydrologic connectivity in human-modified landscapes.},

  abstract = {1. Biogeographical models of species' distributions are essential tools for assessing impacts of changing environmental conditions on natural communities and ecosystems. Practitioners need more reliable predictions to integrate into conservation planning (e.g. reserve design and management). 2. Most models still largely ignore or inappropriately take into account important features of species' distributions, such as spatial autocorrelation, dispersal and migration, biotic and environmental interactions. Whether distributions of natural communities or ecosystems are better modelled by assembling individual species' predictions in a bottom-up approach or modelled as collective entities is another important issue. An international workshop was organized to address these issues. 3. We discuss more specifically six issues in a methodological framework for generalized regression: (i) links with ecological theory; (ii) optimal use of existing data and artificially generated data; (iii) incorporating spatial context; (iv) integrating ecological and environmental interactions; (v) assessing prediction errors and uncertainties; and (vi) predicting distributions of communities or collective properties of biodiversity. 4. Synthesis and applications. Better predictions of the effects of impacts on biological communities and ecosystems can emerge only from more robust species' distribution models and better documentation of the uncertainty associated with these models. An improved understanding of causes of species' distributions, especially at their range limits, as well as of ecological assembly rules and ecosystem functioning, is necessary if further progress is to be made. A better collaborative effort between theoretical and functional ecologists, ecological modellers and statisticians is required to reach these goals},

To illustrate the procedures, we present an in-depth analysis of infant mortality data in the province of British Columbia, Canada.

Recent research on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning has contributed to this goal in several ways. By addressing a new question of high relevance for both science and society, by challenging existing paradigms, by tightly linking theory and experiments, by building scientific consensus beyond differences in opinion, by integrating fragmented disciplines and research fields, by connecting itself to other disciplines and management issues, it has helped transform ecology not only in content, but also in form. Creating a genuine evolutionary ecosystem ecology that links the evolution of species traits at the individual level, the dynamics of species interactions, and the overall functioning of ecosystems would give new impetus to this much-needed process of unification across ecological disciplines.

  abstract = {Abstract. Generalized additive, generalized linear, and classification tree models were developed to predict the distribution of 20 species of chaparral and coastal sage shrubs within the southwest ecoregion of California. Mapped explanatory variables included bioclimatic attributes related to primary environmental regimes: averages of annual precipitation, minimum temperature of the coldest month, maximum temperature of the warmest month, and topographically-distributed potential solar insolation of the wettest quarter (winter) and of the growing season (spring). Also tested for significance were slope angle (related to soil depth) and the geographic coordinates of each observation. Models were parameterized and evaluated based on species presence/absence data from 906 plots surveyed on National Forest lands. Although all variables were significant in at least one of the species' models, those models based only on the bioclimatic variables predicted species presence with 3\textendash{}26\% error. While error would undoubtedly be greater if the models were evaluated using independent data, results indicate that these models are useful for predictive mapping \textendash{} for interpolating species distribution data within the ecoregion. All three methods produced models with similar accuracy for a given species; GAMs were useful for exploring the shape of the response functions, GLMs allowed those response functions to be parameterized and their significance tested, and classification trees, while some-times difficult to interpret, yielded the lowest prediction errors (lower by 3\textendash{}5\%).},

  abstract = {I synthesize the understanding of the relationship between landscape structure and animal movement in human-modified landscapes. 2. The variety of landscape structures is first classified into four categories: continuous habitat, patchy habitat with high-quality matrix, patchy habitat with low-quality matrix, and patchy, ephemeral habitat. Using this simplification I group the range of evolved movement parameters into four categories or movement types. I then discuss how these movement types interact with current human-caused landscape changes, and how this often results in non-optimal movement. 3. From this synthesis I develop a hypothesis that predicts the relative importance of the different population-level consequences of these non-optimal movements, for the four movement types. 4. Populations of species that have inhabited landscapes with high habitat cover or patchy landscapes with low-risk matrix should have evolved low boundary responses and moderate to high movement probabilities. These species are predicted to be highly susceptible to increased movement mortality resulting from habitat loss and reduced matrix quality. 5. In contrast, populations of species that evolved in patchy landscapes with high-risk matrix or dynamic patchy landscapes are predicted to be highly susceptible to decreased immigration and colonization success, due to the increasing patch isolation that results from habitat loss. 6. Finally, I discuss three implications of this synthesis: (i) `least cost path' analysis should not be used for land management decisions without data on actual movement paths and movement risks in the landscape; (ii) `dispersal ability' is not simply an attribute of a species, but varies strongly with landscape structure such that the relative rankings of species' dispersal abilities can change following landscape alteration; and (iii) the assumption that more mobile species are more resilient to human-caused landscape change is not generally true, but depends on the structure of the landscape where the species evolved.},

  abstract = {Many studies have been conducted to quantify the possible ecosystem/landscape response to the anticipated global warming. However, there is a large amount of uncertainty in the future climate predictions used for these studies. Specifically, the climate predictions can be very different based on a variety of global climate models and alternative greenhouse emission scenarios. In this study, we coupled a forest landscape model, LANDIS-II, and a forest process model, PnET-II, to examine the uncertainty (that results from the uncertainty in the future climate predictions) in the forest-type composition prediction for a transitional forest landscape [the Boundary Water Canoe Area]. Using an improved global-sensitivity analysis technique [Fourier amplitude sensitivity test], we also quantified the amount of uncertainty in the forest-type composition prediction contributed by different climate variables including temperature, CO2, precipitation and photosynthetic active radiation (PAR). The forest landscape response was simulated for the period 2000\textendash{}2400ad based on the differential responses of 13 tree species under an ensemble of 27 possible climate prediction profiles (monthly time series of climate variables). Our simulations indicate that the uncertainty in the forest-type composition becomes very high after 2200ad, which is close to the time when the current forests are largely removed by windthrow disturbances and natural mortality. The most important source of uncertainty in the forest-type composition prediction is from the uncertainty in temperature predictions. The second most important source is PAR, the third is CO2 and the least important is precipitation. Our results also show that if the optimum photosynthetic temperature rises due to CO2 enrichment, the forest landscape response to climatic change measured by forest-type composition may be substantially reduced.

  abstract = {Analyses of ecological data should account for the uncertainty in the process(es) that generated the data. However, accounting for these uncertainties is a difficult task, since ecology is known for its complexity. Measurement and/or process errors are often the only sources of uncertainty modeled when addressing complex ecological problems, yet analyses should also account for uncertainty in sampling design, in model specification, in parameters governing the specified model, and in initial and boundary conditions. Only then can we be confident in the scientific inferences and forecasts made from an analysis. Probability and statistics provide a framework that accounts for multiple sources of uncertainty. Given the complexities of ecological studies, the hierarchical statistical model is an invaluable tool. This approach is not new in ecology, and there are many examples (both Bayesian and non-Bayesian) in the literature illustrating the benefits of this approach. In this article, we provide a baseline for concepts, notation, and methods, from which discussion on hierarchical statistical modeling in ecology can proceed. We have also planted some seeds for discussion and tried to show where the practical difficulties lie. Our thesis is that hierarchical statistical modeling is a powerful way of approaching ecological analysis in the presence of inevitable but quantifiable uncertainties, even if practical issues sometimes require pragmatic compromises.},

Applying the model to a dataset on the occurrence of breeding birds in Berkshire, UK, demonstrated that the technique resulted in significant reductions in reserve boundary length relative to solutions produced by the standard set-covering formulation. Computational results showed that moderately large reserve network selection problems could be solved without issue. Alternative solutions may be produced to explore trade-offs between boundary length, number of sites required or alternative criteria.},

The loss of vital nodes, like telecommunication switching centers, is evaluated utilizing a developed spatial optimization model.

Local to national-scale interventions to promote sustainable land use may have unintended effects owing to a displacement of land use within and across countries. Such leakage or 'indirect land use change' critically depends on international geographies of trade. Computing various material flows and environmental indicators embodied in international trade highlights the differences between producer and consumer-based biophysical accounting. Causal attribution of the links between material and monetary flows across countries, and actual land changes and environmental impacts at local level requires a combination of economic simulation models, statistical studies, place-based empirical studies, value chain analyses, and biophysical accounting. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {The current favourable numerical status of most arctic-breeding goose populations conceals an increasing dependence on man-modified habitats for much of the year. Almost all populations are now heavily dependent on agricultural crops when the birds are away from the arctic breeding grounds. We examine the current understanding of the ecology of migration, highlighting the role of hot spots that provide fuelling stations which bridge the gap between the wintering and breeding grounds. Isotopic signatures of eggs indicate nutrients are being flown into the breeding grounds from afar. The susceptibility of geese to disturbance at these stopover sites, many of which are agricultural lands, may lead to reproductive failures. The near-complete loss of natural habitat, even in northern sites, makes the birds captive of agricultural policy. Barnacle Geese Branta leucopsis staging on managed grassland on their spring stopover accumulate more fat but less protein compared to traditional sites, and there is evidence of lower breeding success for individuals feeding on cultivated grass. This population, breeding on Spitsbergen, has been closely followed during a phase of population increase over the past thirty years. We show that although locally on the breeding grounds density-dependent effects have been confirmed (lower reproductive output, enhanced emigration) new colonies are still arising, and there has been no slowing of overall growth of the population. Worldwide, the most spectacular response to agricultural change is that of the Lesser Snow Goose Anser caerulescens caerulescens. The populations have become so numerous that their spring grubbing activities are having a deleterious impact on arctic wetlands where they breed. It would be erroneous to generalise this example to conclude all long-distance migrating geese should be reduced. Current management polices are insufficiently grounded in basic research on the interaction of geese and their food resources which must include experiments in view of impending climate change. We advocate a vigorous intensification of individual-based research programmes.},

In extreme cases, a few individuals give rise to the majority of secondary infections, which have been termed super spreading events. Here, we show that transmission of West Nile virus (WNV) is dominated by extreme heterogeneity in the host community, resulting in highly inflated reproductive ratios. A single relatively uncommon avian species, American robin (Turdus migratorius), appeared to be responsible for the majority of WNV-infectious mosquitoes and acted as the species equivalent of a super spreader for this multi-host pathogen. Crows were also highly preferred by mosquitoes at some sites, while house sparrows were significantly avoided. Nonetheless, due to their relative rarity, corvids (crows and jays) were relatively unimportant in WNV amplification. These results challenge current beliefs about the role of certain avian species in WNV amplification and demonstrate the importance of determining contact rates between vectors and host species to understand pathogen transmission dynamics.},

We argue that concepts from economic geography can help land change science move beyond neoclassical framings. The first concept is that the economic (including markets, commodities, and rational decision-makers) is neither separate nor universal, but is historical and socially embedded. The second is to use these notions to understand the spatial organization of economic activity. The framework of global production networks, in particular, will help land change scientists conceptualize and represent teleconnections. Using economic geography to move beyond neoclassical economic framings will bring a fresh approach to economic change that holds much promise for invigorating land change science. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The importance of biodiversity might be enhanced when multiple ecosystem processes (termed multifunctionality) and environmental contexts are considered, yet no studies have quantified this explicitly to date. We measured five key processes and their combined multifunctionality at three temperatures (5, 10 and 15~$^\circ$C) in freshwater aquaria containing different animal assemblages (1-4 benthic macroinvertebrate species). For single processes, biodiversity effects were weak and were best predicted by additive-based models, i.e. polyculture performances represented the sum of their monoculture parts. There were, however, significant effects of biodiversity on multifunctionality at the low and the high (but not the intermediate) temperature. Variation in the contribution of species to processes across temperatures meant that greater biodiversity was required to sustain multifunctionality across different temperatures than was the case for single processes. This suggests that previous studies might have underestimated the importance of biodiversity in sustaining ecosystem functioning in a changing environment.},

To avoid misinterpretation, existing definitions of alpha and beta must be replaced by a definition that partitions diversity into independent alpha and beta components. Such a unique definition is derived here. When these new alpha and beta components are transformed into their numbers equivalents (effective numbers of elements), Whittaker's multiplicative law (alpha x beta = gamma) is necessarily true for all indices. The new beta gives the effective number of distinct communities. The most popular similarity and overlap measures of ecology (Jaccard, Sorensen, Horn, and Morisita-Horn indices) are monotonic transformations of the new beta diversity. Shannon measures follow deductively from this formalism and do not need to be borrowed from information theory; they are shown to be the only standard diversity measures which can be decomposed into meaningful independent alpha and beta components when community weights are unequal.},

  abstract = {The introduction of nonnative pathogens is altering the scale, magnitude, and persistence of forest disturbance regimes in the western United States. In the high-altitude whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) forests of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE), white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola) is an introduced fungal pathogen that is now the principal cause of tree mortality in many locations. Although blister rust eradication has failed in the past, there is nonetheless substantial interest in monitoring the disease and its rate of progression in order to predict the future impact of forest disturbances within this critical ecosystem. This study integrates data from five different field-monitoring campaigns from 1968 to 2008 to create a blister rust infection model for sites located throughout the GYE. Our model parameterizes the past rates of blister rust spread in order to project its future impact on high-altitude whitebark pine forests. Because the process of blister rust infection and mortality of individuals occurs over the time frame of many years, the model in this paper operates on a yearly time step and defines a series of whitebark pine infection classes: susceptible, slightly infected, moderately infected, and dead. In our analysis, we evaluate four different infection models that compare local vs. global density dependence on the dynamics of blister rust infection. We compare models in which blister rust infection is: (1) independent of the density of infected trees, (2) locally density-dependent, (3) locally density-dependent with a static global infection rate among all sites, and (4) both locally and globally density-dependent. Model evaluation through the predictive loss criterion for Bayesian analysis supports the model that is both locally and globally density-dependent. Using this best-fit model, we predicted the average residence times for the four stages of blister rust infection in our model, and we found that, on average, whitebark pine trees within the GYE remain susceptible for 6.7 years, take 10.9 years to transition from slightly infected to moderately infected, and take 9.4 years to transition from moderately infected to dead. Using our best-fit model, we project the future levels of blister rust infestation in the GYE at critical sites over the next 20 years.},

The gauge network is a key driver in hydrologic modeling to characterize discharge. The accuracy of precipitation is dependent on the location of stations, the density of the network, and the interpolation scheme. Our study examines 16 weather stations in a 64 km2 catchment. We develop a weighted, distributed approach for gap-filling the observed meteorological dataset. We analyze five interpolation methods (Thiessen, IDW, nearest neighbor, spline, and ordinary Kriging) at five gauge densities. We utilize precipitation in a SWAT model to estimate discharge in lumped parameter simulations and in a distributed approach at the multiple densities (1, 16, 50, 142, and 300 stations). Gauge density has a substantial impact on distributed discharge and the optimal gauge density is between 50 and 142 stations. Our results also indicate that the IDW interpolation scheme was optimum, although the Kriging and Thiessen polygon methods produced similar results. To further examine variability in discharge, we characterized the land use and soil distribution throughout each of the subbasins. The optimal rain gauge position and distribution of the gauges drastically influence catchment-wide runoff. We found that it is best to locate the gauges near less permeable locations.},

  abstract = {Natural enemies and environmental factors likely both influence the population cycles of many forest-defoliating insect species. Previous work suggests precipitation influences the spatiotemporal patterns of gypsy moth outbreaks in North America, and it has been hypothesized that precipitation could act indirectly through effects on pathogens. We investigated the potential role of climatic and environmental factors in driving pathogen epizootics and parasitism at 57 sites over an area of $\approx$72,300~km(2) in four US mid-Atlantic states during the final year (2009) of a gypsy moth outbreak. Prior work has largely reported that the Lymantria dispar nucleopolyhedrovirus (LdNPV) was the principal mortality agent responsible for regional collapses of gypsy moth outbreaks. However, in the gypsy moth outbreak-prone US mid-Atlantic region, the fungal pathogen Entomophaga maimaiga has replaced the virus as the dominant source of mortality in dense host populations. The severity of the gypsy moth population crash, measured as the decline in egg mass densities from 2009 to 2010, tended to increase with the prevalence of E. maimaiga and larval parasitoids, but not LdNPV. A significantly negative spatial association was detected between rates of fungal mortality and parasitism, potentially indicating displacement of parasitoids by E. maimaiga. Fungal, viral, and parasitoid mortality agents differed in their associations with local abiotic and biotic conditions, but precipitation significantly influenced both fungal and viral prevalence. This study provides the first spatially robust evidence of the dominance of E. maimaiga during the collapse of a gypsy moth outbreak and highlights the important role played by microclimatic conditions.},

Study of plant community response to these combined disturbances is critical for our understanding and management of these pine forests. Based on data collected from an experimental burn project in central interior British Columbia, Canada, we investigate variation in understory plant communities along a gradient of disturbance that includes MPB-only and red-phase MPB. +. fire across three levels of fire severity. We compare communities pre-fire and five years post-fire using three hypotheses that predict community response to disturbance: the light hypothesis, the divergence-convergence hypothesis, and the fire severity begets pine hypothesis.Comparisons of pine and fir tree seedling tallies suggest a divergence in composition along the disturbance severity gradient. Pine seedlings were mostly absent from the unburned treatment but dominated the burned treatments with densities increasing at higher severities. For the non-tree understory community, canopy-opening associated with both unburned and with low through moderate-high severity burning results in a convergence of general plant community structure demonstrated by rank-abundance curves, but divergent community membership associated with fire severity and fire-adaptive traits. Communities in the unburned treatment saw a release due to canopy opening that supported increases in the dominant shrubs and understory fir seedlings. In the burned treatments, shrubs also increased in dominance and community membership was determined by fire-adaptive traits with fire-adapted species being most abundant in the highest severity fire treatments. Overall, the communities appear to be resilient to the combined effects of MPB (red-phase) and low to moderate-high severity burning, but further research is required in the grey-phase of beetle-kill to broaden our understanding of the landscape legacy of this recent insect outbreak.},

  abstract = {Insects and diseases are common disturbance agents in forested ecosystems. Severe outbreaks can cause significant changes in tree species composition, age structure, and fuel conditions over broad areas. To investigate the role of biological disturbances in shaping forest landscapes over time, we constructed a new "biological disturbance agent" (BDA) module for a landscape-level forest succession and disturbance simulator, LANDIS. The BDA module is designed to simulate tree mortality following major outbreaks of insects and/or disease. Major outbreaks are defined as those significant enough to influence forest succession, fire disturbance, or harvest disturbance at landscape scales. Module design is flexible to accommodate a diversity of life history traits characterizing destructive insects and diseases, and more than one BDA can be simulated to examine their interactions. Five main elements control the probability of biological disturbance within the module: (1) local host dominance on a given site; (2) host value modifiers that reflect environmental conditions and recent disturbance history; (3) host dominance within a user-specified neighborhood; (4) the temporal outbreak pattern characteristic of the BDA, and (5) BDA dispersal in cases where the annual dispersal range of the BDA is small relative to the study area. In this paper, we describe the first four elements of the BDA module, and present the initial testing of the module on a variety of neutral landscape patterns, using Eastern spruce budworm as a test case. Our results are consistent with published successional patterns of spruce-fir and mixed forests affected by spruce budworm, but also highlight areas of uncertainty in the spatio-temporal patterns of budworm-caused tree mortality and biological disturbances in general. We suggest that the behavior of the module is consistent with the design and intended purpose of LANDIS as a probabilistic landscape-level simulator of forest disturbance and succession. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

However, the effect of nutrient supplies on within-host microbial interactions is poorly understood. Resource competition is a promising theory for understanding microbial interactions, because microparasites require nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) for synthesis of macromolecules such as nucleic acids and proteins. To better understand the effects of nutrient supplies to hosts on pathogen interactions, we singly inoculated and coinoculated Avena sativa with two virus species, barley yellow dwarf virus-PAV (BYDV-PAV) and cereal yellow dwarf virus-RPV (CYDV-RPV). Host plants were grown across a factorial combination of N and P supply rates that created a gradient of N~:~P supply ratios, one being replicated at low and high nutrient supply. Nutrient supply affected prevalence and the interaction strength among viruses. P addition lowered CYDV-RPV prevalence. The two viruses had a distinct competitive hierarchy: the coinoculation of BYDV-PAV lowered CYDV-RPV infection rate, but the reverse was not true. This antagonistic interaction occurred at low nutrient supply rates and disappeared at high N supply rate. Given the global scale of human alterations of N and P cycles, these results suggest that elevated nutrient supply will increase risks of virus coinfection with likely effects on virus epidemiology, virulence and evolution.},

  issn = {1476-069X},
  doi = {10.1186/1476-069X-13-89},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Climate change has increased the days of unseasonal temperature. Although many studies have examined the association between temperature and mortality, few have examined the timing of exposure where whether this association varies depending on the exposure month even at the same temperature. Therefore, we investigated monthly differences in the effects of temperature on mortality in a study comprising a wide range of weather and years, and we also investigated heterogeneity among regions.

METHODS: We analyzed 38,005,616 deaths from 148 cities in the U.S. from 1973 through 2006. We fit city specific Poisson regressions to examine the effect of temperature on mortality separately for each month of the year, using penalized splines. We used cluster analysis to group cities with similar weather patterns, and combined results across cities within clusters using meta-smoothing.

RESULTS: There was substantial variation in the effects of the same temperature by month. Heat effects were larger in the spring and early summer and cold effects were larger in late fall. In addition, heat effects were larger in clusters where high temperatures were less common, and vice versa for cold effects.

CONCLUSIONS: The effects of a given temperature on mortality vary spatially and temporally based on how unusual it is for that time and location. This suggests changes in variability of temperature may be more important for health as climate changes than changes of mean temperature. More emphasis should be placed on warnings targeted to early heat/cold temperature for the season or month rather than focusing only on the extremes.},

  abstract = {Pathogens are considered to drive ecological and evolutionary dynamics of plant populations, but we lack data measuring the population-level consequences of infection in wild plant-pathogen interactions. Moreover, while it is often assumed that offseason environmental conditions drive seasonal declines in pathogen population size, little is known about how offseason environmental conditions impact the survival of pathogen resting stages, and how critical the offseason is for the next season's epidemic. The fungal pathogen Podosphaera plantaginis persists as a dynamic metapopulation in the large network of Plantago lanceolata host populations. Here, we analyze long-term data to measure the spatial synchrony of epidemics and consequences of infection for over 4000 host populations. Using a theoretical model, we study whether large-scale environmental change could synchronize disease occurrence across the metapopulation. During 2001-2013 exposure to freezing decreased, while pathogen extinction-colonization-persistence rates became more synchronized. Simulations of a theoretical model suggest that increasingly favorable winter conditions for pathogen survival could drive such synchronization. Our data also show that infection decreases host population growth. These results confirm that mild winter conditions increase pathogen overwintering success and thus increase disease prevalence across the metapopulation. Further, we conclude that the pathogen can drive host population growth in the Plantago-Podosphaera system.},

Predictions routinely focus on the direct effects of climate change on individual species, yet interactions between species can strongly influence how climate change affects organisms at every scale by altering their individual fitness, geographic ranges and the structure and dynamics of their community. Failure to incorporate these interactions limits the ability to predict responses of species to climate change. We propose a framework based on ideas from global-change biology, community ecology, and invasion biology that uses community modules to assess how species interactions shape responses to climate change.},

  abstract = {With the transport of plants around the globe, exotic species can readily spread disease to their native relatives; however, they can also provide genetic resistance to those relatives through hybrid breeding programs. American chestnut (Castanea dentata) was an abundant tree species in North America until its decimation by introduced chestnut blight. To restore chestnut in North America, efforts are ongoing to test putative blight-resistant hybrids of C. dentata and Chinese chestnut (C. mollissima), but little is known about the ecology of C. mollissima. In a forest in northeastern USA in which C. mollissima has become established, we explored questions of stand dynamics, health, and genetic relationships of C. mollissima offspring to an adjacent parent orchard. We found C. mollissima was adapted and randomly distributed among native species in this relatively young forest. The genetics of the C. mollissima population compared to its parents indicated little effect of selection pressure as each of the parent trees contributed at least one offspring. The ease with which this exotic species proliferated questions why C. mollissima is rare elsewhere in forests of North America. It is likely that a time window of low animal predation allowed seedlings to establish, and the shallow soil at this site limited the maximum forest canopy height, permitting the characteristically short-statured C. mollissima to avoid suppression. Our results indicate that because C. mollissima exhibited pioneer species characteristics, hybrids between C. mollissima and C. dentata have the potential to be successful pioneer species of future forests in North America, and we challenge the paradigm that exotic tree species are wholly detrimental to native biodiversity. We contend that exotic tree species should be assessed not only by their level of threat to native species, but also by their potential positive impacts on ecosystems via hybrid breeding programs.},

  abstract = {Understanding how institutional changes within academia may affect the overall potential of science requires a better quantitative representation of how careers evolve over time. Because knowledge spillovers, cumulative advantage, competition, and collaboration are distinctive features of the academic profession, both the employment relationship and the procedures for assigning recognition and allocating funding should be designed to account for these factors. We study the annual production n(i)(t) of a given scientist i by analyzing longitudinal career data for 200 leading scientists and 100 assistant professors from the physics community. Our empirical analysis of individual productivity dynamics shows that (i) there are increasing returns for the top individuals within the competitive cohort, and that (ii) the distribution of production growth is a leptokurtic "tent-shaped" distribution that is remarkably symmetric. Our methodology is general, and we speculate that similar features appear in other disciplines where academic publication is essential and collaboration is a key feature. We introduce a model of proportional growth which reproduces these two observations, and additionally accounts for the significantly right-skewed distributions of career longevity and achievement in science. Using this theoretical model, we show that short-term contracts can amplify the effects of competition and uncertainty making careers more vulnerable to early termination, not necessarily due to lack of individual talent and persistence, but because of random negative production shocks. We show that fluctuations in scientific production are quantitatively related to a scientist's collaboration radius and team efficiency.},

  doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0034338},
  abstract = {Despite recent papers on problems associated with full-model and stepwise regression, their use is still common throughout ecological and environmental disciplines. Alternative approaches, including generating multiple models and comparing them post-hoc using techniques such as Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC), are becoming more popular. However, these are problematic when there are numerous independent variables and interpretation is often difficult when competing models contain many different variables and combinations of variables. Here, we detail a new approach, REVS (Regression with Empirical Variable Selection), which uses all-subsets regression to quantify empirical support for every independent variable. A series of models is created; the first containing the variable with most empirical support, the second containing the first variable and the next most-supported, and so on. The comparatively small number of resultant models (n$\mkern1mu$=$\mkern1mu$the number of predictor variables) means that post-hoc comparison is comparatively quick and easy. When tested on a real dataset--habitat and offspring quality in the great tit (Parus major)--the optimal REVS model explained more variance (higher R(2)), was more parsimonious (lower AIC), and had greater significance (lower P values), than full, stepwise or all-subsets models; it also had higher predictive accuracy based on split-sample validation. Testing REVS on ten further datasets suggested that this is typical, with R(2) values being higher than full or stepwise models (mean improvement$\mkern1mu$=$\mkern1mu$31\% and 7\%, respectively). Results are ecologically intuitive as even when there are several competing models, they share a set of "core" variables and differ only in presence/absence of one or two additional variables. We conclude that REVS is useful for analysing complex datasets, including those in ecology and environmental disciplines.},

However, whether these same processes also promote stability in forest ecosystems has never been tested. Using tree ring data from permanent forest plots across Europe, we show that aboveground wood production is inherently more stable through time in mixed-species forests. Faster rates of wood production (i.e. overyielding), decreased year-to-year variation in productivity through asynchronous responses of species to climate, and greater temporal stability in the growth rates of individual tree species all contributed strongly to stabilising productivity in mixed stands. Together, these findings reveal the central role of diversity in stabilising productivity in forests, and bring us closer to understanding the processes which enable diverse forests to remain productive under a wide range of environmental conditions.},

We present a general framework for modelling FIP disturbances through their impacts on tree ecophysiology. Five pathways are identified as the basis for functional groupings: increases in leaf, stem and root turnover, and reductions in phloem and xylem transport. A simple ecophysiological model was used to explore the sensitivity of forest growth, mortality and ecosystem fluxes to varying outbreak severity. Across all pathways, low infection was associated with growth reduction but limited mortality. Moderate infection led to individual tree mortality, whereas high levels led to stand-level die-offs delayed over multiple years. Delayed mortality is consistent with observations and critical for capturing biophysical, biogeochemical and successional responses. This framework enables novel predictions under present and future global change scenarios.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Human pathogen richness and prevalence vary widely across the globe, yet we know little about whether global patterns found in other taxa also predict diversity in this important group of organisms. This study (a) assesses the relative importance of temperature, precipitation, habitat diversity, and population density on the global distributions of human pathogens and (b) evaluates the species-area predictions of island biogeography for human pathogen distributions on oceanic islands.

METHODS: Historical data were used in order to minimize the influence of differential access to modern health care on pathogen prevalence. The database includes coded data (pathogen, environmental and cultural) for a worldwide sample of 186 non-industrial cultures, including 37 on islands. Prevalence levels for 10 pathogens were combined into a pathogen prevalence index, and OLS regression was used to model the environmental determinants of the prevalence index and number of pathogens.

RESULTS: Pathogens (number and prevalence index) showed the expected latitudinal gradient, but predictors varied by latitude. Pathogens increased with temperature in high-latitude zones, while mean annual precipitation was a more important predictor in low-latitude zones. Other environmental factors associated with more pathogens included seasonal dry extremes, frost-free climates, and human population density outside the tropics. Islands showed the expected species-area relationship for all but the smallest islands, and the relationship was not mediated by habitat diversity. Although geographic distributions of free-living and parasitic taxa typically have different determinants, these data show that variables that influence the distribution of free-living organisms also shape the global distribution of human pathogens. Understanding the cause of these distributions is potentially important, since geographical variation in human pathogens has an important influence on global disparities in human welfare.},

  abstract = {Many pathogens infect more than one host species, and clarifying how these different hosts contribute to pathogen dynamics can facilitate the management of pathogens and can lend insight into the functioning of pathogens in ecosystems. In this study, we investigated a suite of native and non-native amphibian hosts of the pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) across multiple scales to identify potential mechanisms that may drive infection patterns in the Colorado study system. Specifically, we aimed to determine if: 1) amphibian populations vary in Bd infection across the landscape, 2) amphibian community composition predicts infection (e.g., does the presence or abundance of any particular species influence infection in others?), 3) amphibian species vary in their ability to produce infectious zoospores in a laboratory infection, 4) heterogeneity in host ability observed in the laboratory scales to predict patterns of Bd prevalence in the landscape. We found that non-native North American bullfrogs (Lithobates catesbeianus) are widespread and have the highest prevalence of Bd infection relative to the other native species in the landscape. Additionally, infection in some native species appears to be related to the density of sympatric L. catesbeianus populations. At the smaller host scale, we found that L. catesbeianus produces more of the infective zoospore stage relative to some native species, but that this zoospore output does not scale to predict infection in sympatric wild populations of native species. Rather, landscape level infection relates most strongly to density of hosts at a wetland as well as abiotic factors. While non-native L. catesbeianus have high levels of Bd infection in the Colorado Front Range system, we also identified Bd infection in a number of native amphibian populations allopatric with L. catesbeianus, suggesting that multiple host species are important contributors to the dynamics of the Bd pathogen in this landscape.},

  abstract = {In frequently burned ecosystems, many plants persist by repeated resprouting from basal or belowground buds. This strategy requires that plants reach a balance between biomass loss and recovery, which depends on the shape of the relationship between pre- and post-fire size. Previous analyses of this relationship, however, have focused on the size of the largest stem, which ignores the importance of the multi-stem growth habit that is common in pyrogenic ecosystems. We hypothesized that the presence of multiple stems causes a substantial shift in the relationship between pre- and post-fire size and in the relationship between pre-fire size and size recovery. We measured the height and basal diameter, then calculated volume and biomass, of all stems of six tree species before and nine months after complete removal of aboveground biomass via coppicing. The number of resprouts was correlated with the original number of stems for four species. For all species, the relationship between pre-coppicing and resprout size fit a positive curvilinear function, and the shape of this curve did not differ for maximum and total stem size. Smaller individuals recovered a larger proportion of their pre-coppicing size than larger individuals, but the shape of the size recovery curves were the same regardless of whether the analysis was performed with all stems or only the largest stem. Our results indicate that measuring only the largest stem of multi-stemmed individuals is sufficient to assess the ability of individuals to recover after complete loss of aboveground biomass and persist under frequent burning.},

  volume = {22},

  abstract = {Insect disturbance is often thought to increase fire risk through enhanced fuel loadings, particularly in coniferous forest ecosystems. Yet insect disturbances also affect successional pathways and landscape structure that interact with fire disturbances (and vice-versa) over longer time scales. We applied a landscape succession and disturbance model (LANDIS-II) to evaluate the relative strength of interactions between spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana) outbreaks and fire disturbances in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area (BWCA) in northern Minnesota (USA). Disturbance interactions were evaluated for two different scenarios: presettlement forests and fire regimes vs. contemporary forests and fire regimes. Forest composition under the contemporary scenario trended toward mixtures of deciduous species (primarily Betula papyrifera and Populus spp.) and shade-tolerant conifers (Picea mariana, Abies balsamea, Thuja occidentalis), with disturbances dominated by a combination of budworm defoliation and high-severity fires. The presettlement scenario retained comparatively more "big pines" (i.e., Pinus strobus, P. resinosa) and tamarack (L. laricina), and experienced less budworm disturbance and a comparatively less-severe fire regime. Spruce budworm disturbance decreased area burned and fire severity under both scenarios when averaged across the entire 300-year simulations. Contrary to past research, area burned and fire severity during outbreak decades were each similar to that observed in non-outbreak decades. Our analyses suggest budworm disturbances within forests of the BWCA have a comparatively weak effect on long-term forest composition due to a combination of characteristics. These include strict host specificity, fine-scaled patchiness created by defoliation damage, and advance regeneration of its primary host, balsam fir (A. balsamea) that allows its host to persist despite repeated disturbances. Understanding the nature of the three-way interaction between budworm, fire, and composition has important ramifications for both fire mitigation strategies and ecosystem restoration initiatives. We conclude that budworm disturbance can partially mitigate long-term future fire risk by periodically reducing live ladder fuel within the mixed forest types of the BWCA but will do little to reverse the compositional trends caused in part by reduced fire rotations.},

  abstract = {Humans increasingly occupy cities. Globally, about 50\% of the total human population lives in urban environments, and in spite of some trends for deurbanization, the transition from rural to urban life is expected to accelerate in the future, especially in developing nations and regions. The Republic of Korea, for example, has witnessed a dramatic rise in its urban population, which now accounts for nearly 90\% of all residents; the increase from about 29\% in 1955 has been attributed to multiple factors, but has clearly been driven by extraordinary growth in the gross domestic product accompanying industrialization. While industrialization and urbanization have unarguably led to major improvements in quality of life indices in Korea and elsewhere, numerous serious problems have also been acknowledged, including concerns about resource availability, water quality, amplification of global warming and new threats to health. Questions about sustainability have therefore led Koreans and others to consider deurbanization as a management policy. Whether this offers any realistic prospects for a sustainable future remains to be seen. In the interim, it has become increasingly clear that built environments are no less complex than natural environments, and that they depend on a variety of internal and external connections involving microbes and the processes for which microbes are responsible. I provide here a definition of the urban microbiome, and through examples indicate its centrality to human function and wellbeing in urban systems. I also identify important knowledge gaps and unanswered questions about urban microbiomes that must be addressed to develop a robust, predictive and general understanding of urban biology and ecology that can be used to inform policy-making for sustainable systems.},

We investigated the effects of fragmentation on plant species richness and abundance in 30 remnant Banksia woodlands in the rapidly expanding city of Perth, located in the southwestern Australian global biodiversity hotspot. We considered a comprehensive set of factors characterizing landscape fragmentation dynamics (current and historical remnant area and connectivity, time since isolation, and trajectories of landscape change), disturbance regimes (fire frequency, grazing, and intensity of human activities), and local environmental conditions (soil nutrient status and litter depth). We used generalized linear mixed models to determine the interactive effects of time since remnant isolation and remnant area on plant species richness, and structural equation models to disentangle the direct and indirect effects of landscape and local factors on plant species richness and abundance. Fragmentation impacts were most rapid in smaller remnants. Indeed, in the small remnants, native plant species richness was halved in only a few decades after isolation, suggesting an underlying rapid loss of habitat quality. We found that richness and abundance of woody species were higher in historically large remnants and lower in the rural areas, despite these rural remnants showing greater connectivity. Richness of native herbaceous species declined with time since isolation, mainly in the smaller remnants, and this was associated with altered soil properties. Furthermore, increased litter depth (possibly indicating higher productivity) and increased abundance of nonnative herbaceous species in the older and smaller remnants was associated with a decline in the abundance of native herbaceous species.

While these hypotheses have generated numerous reviews and meta-analyses, as well as persistent criticism, two prominent papers have recently concluded that both of these hypotheses should be abandoned because of theoretical weaknesses and failure to predict observed diversity patterns. I review these criticisms in the context of the continuing tension between logic and empiricism in the development of ecological theory, and conclude that most of the criticisms are misguided because they fail to recognize the inherent connections between these two hypotheses, and consequently fail to test them appropriately. The logic of every hypothesis is based on the underlying assumptions.

A key prediction of this framework is that the effects of biotic interactions will be averaged out at macroscales - an idea termed the Eltonian noise hypothesis (ENH). We test this prediction by quantifying regional variation in local abiotic and biotic niche relations and assess the role of macroclimate in structuring biotic interactions, using a non-native invasive grass, Microstegium vimineum, in its introduced range. Consistent with hierarchical niche relations and the ENH, macroclimate structures local biotic interactions, while local abiotic relations are regionally conserved. Biotic interactions suppress M. vimineum in drier climates but have little effect in wetter climates. A similar approach could be used to identify the macroclimatic conditions under which biotic interactions affect the accuracy of local predictions of species distributions.},

To account for these factors, the classic Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Susceptible epidemic model is modified to include a compartment representing the amount of free-living pathogen within the environment. The model accounts for host demography, direct and indirect transmission, replication of free-living pathogens in the environment, and removal of free-living pathogens by natural death or environmental decontamination. Based on the assumptions of the deterministic model, a continuous-time Markov chain model is developed. An estimate for the probability of disease extinction or a major outbreak is obtained by approximating the Markov chain with a multitype branching process. Numerical simulations illustrate important differences between the deterministic and stochastic counterparts, relevant for outbreak prevention, that depend on indirect transmission, pathogen shedding by infectious hosts, replication of free-living pathogens, and environmental decontamination. The probability of a major outbreak is computed for salmonellosis in a herd of dairy cattle as well as cholera in a human population. An explicit expression for the probability of disease extinction or a major outbreak in terms of the model parameters is obtained for systems with no direct transmission or replication of free-living pathogens.},

We illustrate how three key themes that are currently addressed separately in the urban sustainability and land change literatures can lead to incorrect conclusions and misleading results when they are not examined jointly: the traditional system of land classification that is based on discrete categories and reinforces the false idea of a rural-urban dichotomy; the spatial quantification of land change that is based on place-based relationships, ignoring the connections between distant places, especially between urban functions and rural land uses; and the implicit assumptions about path dependency and sequential land changes that underlie current conceptualizations of land transitions. We then examine several environmental "grand challenges" and discuss how urban land teleconnections could help research communities frame scientific inquiries. Finally, we point to existing analytical approaches that can be used to advance development and application of the concept.},

  doi = {10.1111/gcb.12615},
  abstract = {Climate warming is projected to affect forest water yields but the effects are expected to vary. We investigated how forest type and age affect water yield resilience to climate warming. To answer this question, we examined the variability in historical water yields at long-term experimental catchments across Canada and the United States over 5-year cool and warm periods. Using the theoretical framework of the Budyko curve, we calculated the effects of climate warming on the annual partitioning of precipitation (P) into evapotranspiration (ET) and water yield. Deviation (d) was defined as a catchment's change in actual ET divided by P [AET/P; evaporative index (EI)] coincident with a shift from a cool to a warm period - a positive d indicates an upward shift in EI and smaller than expected water yields, and a negative d indicates a downward shift in EI and larger than expected water yields. Elasticity was defined as the ratio of interannual variation in potential ET divided by P (PET/P; dryness index) to interannual variation in the EI - high elasticity indicates low d despite large range in drying index (i.e., resilient water yields), low elasticity indicates high d despite small range in drying index (i.e., nonresilient water yields). Although the data needed to fully evaluate ecosystems based on these metrics are limited, we were able to identify some characteristics of response among forest types. Alpine sites showed the greatest sensitivity to climate warming with any warming leading to increased water yields. Conifer forests included catchments with lowest elasticity and stable to larger water yields. Deciduous forests included catchments with intermediate elasticity and stable to smaller water yields. Mixed coniferous/deciduous forests included catchments with highest elasticity and stable water yields. Forest type appeared to influence the resilience of catchment water yields to climate warming, with conifer and deciduous catchments more susceptible to climate warming than the more diverse mixed forest catchments.},

  abstract = {The persistence of mutualisms in host-microbial - or holobiont - systems is difficult to explain because microbial mutualists, who bear the costs of providing benefits to their host, are always prone to being competitively displaced by non-mutualist 'cheater' species. This disruptive effect of competition is expected to be particularly strong when the benefits provided by the mutualists entail costs such as reduced competitive ability. Using a metacommunity model, we show that competition between multiple cheaters within the host's microbiome, when combined with the spatial structure of host-microbial interactions, can have a constructive rather than a disruptive effect by allowing the emergence and maintenance of mutualistic microorganisms within the host. These results indicate that many of the microorganisms inhabiting a host's microbiome, including those that would otherwise be considered opportunistic or even potential pathogens, play a cryptic yet critical role in promoting the health and persistence of the holobiont across spatial scales.},

  doi = {10.1111/gcb.12733},
  abstract = {The world's population is growing and demand for food, feed, fiber, and fuel is increasing, placing greater demand on land and its resources for crop production. We review previously published estimates of global scale cropland availability, discuss the underlying assumptions that lead to differences between estimates, and illustrate the consequences of applying different estimates in model-based assessments of land-use change. The review estimates a range from 1,552 Mha to 5,131 Mha, which includes 1550 Mha that is already cropland. Hence the lowest estimates indicate that there is almost no room for cropland expansion while the highest estimates indicate that cropland could potentially expand to over three times its current area. Differences can largely be attributed to institutional assumptions, i.e. which land covers/uses (e.g. forests or grasslands) are societally or governmentally allowed to convert to cropland, while there was little variation in biophysical assumptions. Estimates based on comparable assumptions showed a variation of up to 84\%, which originated mainly from different underlying data sources. Based on this synthesis of the assumptions underlying these estimates we constructed a high, a medium, and a low estimate of cropland availability that are representative of the range of estimates in the reviewed studies. We apply these estimates in a land-change model to illustrate the consequences on cropland expansion and intensification as well as deforestation. While uncertainty in cropland availability is hardly addressed in global land-use change assessments, the results indicate a large range of estimates with important consequences for model-based assessments.

  abstract = {Plants and animals have responded to past climate changes by migrating with habitable environments, sometimes shifting the boundaries of their geographic ranges by tens of kilometers per year or more. Species migrating in response to present climate conditions, however, must contend with landscapes fragmented by anthropogenic disturbance. We consider this problem in the context of wind-dispersed tree species. Mechanisms of long-distance seed dispersal make these species capable of rapid migration rates. Models of species-front migration suggest that even tree species with the capacity for long-distance dispersal will be unable to keep pace with future spatial changes in temperature gradients, exclusive of habitat fragmentation effects. Here we present a numerical model that captures the salient dynamics of migration by long-distance dispersal for a generic tree species. We then use the model to explore the possible effects of assisted colonization within a fragmented landscape under a simulated tree-planting scheme. Our results suggest that an assisted-colonization program could accelerate species-front migration rates enough to match the speed of climate change, but such a program would involve an environmental-sustainability intervention at a massive scale.},

  doi = {10.1002/ece3.877},
  abstract = {Large shifts in species ranges have been predicted under future climate scenarios based primarily on niche-based species distribution models. However, the mechanisms that would cause such shifts are uncertain. Natural and anthropogenic fires have shaped the distributions of many plant species, but their effects have seldom been included in future projections of species ranges. Here, we examine how the combination of climate and fire influence historical and future distributions of the ponderosa pine-prairie ecotone at the edge of the Black Hills in South Dakota, USA, as simulated by MC1, a dynamic global vegetation model that includes the effects of fire, climate, and atmospheric CO2 concentration on vegetation dynamics. For this purpose, we parameterized MC1 for ponderosa pine in the Black Hills, designating the revised model as MC1-WCNP. Results show that fire frequency, as affected by humidity and temperature, is central to the simulation of historical prairies in the warmer lowlands versus woodlands in the cooler, moister highlands. Based on three downscaled general circulation model climate projections for the 21st century, we simulate greater frequencies of natural fire throughout the area due to substantial warming and, for two of the climate projections, lower relative humidity. However, established ponderosa pine forests are relatively fire resistant, and areas that were initially wooded remained so over the 21st century for most of our future climate x fire management scenarios. This result contrasts with projections for ponderosa pine based on climatic niches, which suggest that its suitable habitat in the Black Hills will be greatly diminished by the middle of the 21st century. We hypothesize that the differences between the future predictions from these two approaches are due in part to the inclusion of fire effects in MC1, and we highlight the importance of accounting for fire as managed by humans in assessing both historical species distributions and future climate change effects.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY In Chile, while dog rabies has decreased markedly over the last 30 years, bat rabies is still reported frequently. In order to shed new light on the spatiotemporal trends of these reports, we analysed active and passive data from years 1985 and 2012, which included 61~076 samples from 289 counties of Chile. We found that from 1994 to 2012, more than 15~000 bat samples were submitted for diagnostics through passive surveillance, 9\textperiodcentered{}5\% of which tested positive for rabies. By contrast, the prevalence of infection was only \~0\textperiodcentered{}4\% among the nearly 12~000 bat samples submitted through active surveillance. We found that the prevalence of dog rabies dropped steadily over the same period, with just a single confirmed case since 1998. None of the 928 samples from wild animals, other than bats, were positive for rabies. Although there has been only one confirmed case of human rabies in Chile since 1985, and a single confirmed case in a dog since 1998, bats remain a reservoir for rabies viruses. While active surveillance indicates that rabies prevalence is low in bat colonies, the high proportion of positive bats submitted through passive surveillance is a concern. To prevent human rabies, local public health agencies should increase research on the basic ecology of bats and the role of stray dogs and cats as potential rabies amplifiers.},

  doi = {10.1111/gcb.12638},
  abstract = {Understanding recent biogeographic responses to climate change is fundamental for improving our predictions of likely future responses and guiding conservation planning at both local and global scales. Studies of observed biogeographic responses to 20th century climate change have principally examined effects related to ubiquitous increases in temperature - collectively termed a warming fingerprint. Although the importance of changes in other aspects of climate - particularly precipitation and water availability - is widely acknowledged from a theoretical standpoint and supported by paleontological evidence, we lack a practical understanding of how these changes interact with temperature to drive biogeographic responses. Further complicating matters, differences in life history and ecological attributes may lead species to respond differently to the same changes in climate. Here, we examine whether recent biogeographic patterns across California are consistent with a warming fingerprint. We describe how various components of climate have changed regionally in California during the 20th century and review empirical evidence of biogeographic responses to these changes, particularly elevational range shifts. Many responses to climate change do not appear to be consistent with a warming fingerprint, with downslope shifts in elevation being as common as upslope shifts across a number of taxa and many demographic and community responses being inconsistent with upslope shifts. We identify a number of potential direct and indirect mechanisms for these responses, including the influence of aspects of climate change other than temperature (e.g., the shifting seasonal balance of energy and water availability), differences in each taxon's sensitivity to climate change, trophic interactions, and land-use change. Finally, we highlight the need to move beyond a warming fingerprint in studies of biogeographic responses by considering a more multifaceted view of climate, emphasizing local-scale effects, and including a priori knowledge of relevant natural history for the taxa and regions under study.},

  doi = {10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753},
  abstract = {A spatially-explicit, stochastic model is developed for Bahia bark scaling, a threat to citrus production in north-eastern Brazil, and is used to assess epidemiological principles underlying the cost-effectiveness of disease control strategies. The model is fitted via Markov chain Monte Carlo with data augmentation to snapshots of disease spread derived from a previously-reported multi-year experiment. Goodness-of-fit tests strongly supported the fit of the model, even though the detailed etiology of the disease is unknown and was not explicitly included in the model. Key epidemiological parameters including the infection rate, incubation period and scale of dispersal are estimated from the spread data. This allows us to scale-up the experimental results to predict the effect of the level of initial inoculum on disease progression in a typically-sized citrus grove. The efficacies of two cultural control measures are assessed: altering the spacing of host plants, and roguing symptomatic trees. Reducing planting density can slow disease spread significantly if the distance between hosts is sufficiently large. However, low density groves have fewer plants per hectare. The optimum density of productive plants is therefore recovered at an intermediate host spacing. Roguing, even when detection of symptomatic plants is imperfect, can lead to very effective control. However, scouting for disease symptoms incurs a cost. We use the model to balance the cost of scouting against the number of plants lost to disease, and show how to determine a roguing schedule that optimises profit. The trade-offs underlying the two optima we identify-the optimal host spacing and the optimal roguing schedule-are applicable to many pathosystems. Our work demonstrates how a carefully parameterised mathematical model can be used to find these optima. It also illustrates how mathematical models can be used in even this most challenging of situations in which the underlying epidemiology is ill-understood.},

Biotic and abiotic effects on plant growth are usually studied in controlled settings examining response to variation in single factors and in field settings with large numbers of variables. Multi-factor experiments with combinations of stresses bridge this gap, increasing our understanding of the genotype-environment-phenotype functional map for the host plant and the affiliated epiphytic community. The maize inbred B73 was exposed to single and combination abiotic and the biotic stress treatments: low nitrogen fertilizer and high levels of infection with southern leaf blight (causal agent Cochliobolus heterostrophus). Microbial epiphyte samples were collected at the vegetative early-season phase and species composition was determined using 16S ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis. Plant traits and level of southern leaf blight disease were measured late-season. Bacterial diversity was different among stress treatment groups (P 0.001). Lower species richness\textemdash{}alpha diversity--was correlated with increased severity of southern leaf blight disease when disease pressure was high. Nitrogen fertilization intensified the decline in bacterial alpha diversity. While no single bacterial ribotype was consistently associated with disease severity, small sets of ribotypes were good predictors of disease levels. Difference in leaf bacterial-epiphyte diversity early in the season were correlated with plant disease severity, supporting further tests of microbial epiphyte-disease correlations for use in predicting disease progression.},

  abstract = {Large trees are critical components of forest ecosystems, but are declining in many forests worldwide. We predicted that growth of large trees is more vulnerable than that of small trees to high temperatures, because respiration and tissue maintenance costs increase with temperature more rapidly than does photosynthesis and these costs may be disproportionately greater in large trees. Using 5~00~000 measurements of eucalypt growth across temperate Australia, we found that high temperatures do appear to impose a larger growth penalty on large trees than on small ones. Average stem diameter growth rates at 21~$^\circ$C compared with 11~$^\circ$C mean annual temperature were 57\% lower for large trees (58~cm stem diameter), but only 29\% lower for small trees (18~cm diameter). While our results are consistent with an impaired carbon budget for large trees at warmer sites, we cannot discount causes such as hydraulic stress. We conclude that slower growth rates will impede recovery from extreme events, exacerbating the effects of higher temperatures, increased drought stress and more frequent fire on the tall eucalypt forests of southern Australia.},

  abstract = {Abstract Primary axes of host developmental tempo (HDT; e.g., slow-quick return continuum) represent latent biological processes and are increasingly used to a priori identify hosts that contribute disproportionately more to pathogen transmission. The influence of HDT on host contributions to transmission depends on how HDT influences both resistance and tolerance of disease. Here, we use structural equation modeling to address known limitations of conventional measures of resistance and tolerance. We first provide a general resistance-tolerance metamodel from which system-specific models can be derived. We then develop a model specific to a group of vector-transmitted viruses that infect hundreds of grass species worldwide. We tested the model using experimental inoculations of six phylogenetically paired grass species. We found that (1) host traits covaried according to a prominent HDT axis, the slow-quick continuum; (2) infection caused a greater reduction in the performance of quick returns, with 80\% of that greater impact explained by lesser resistance; (3) resistance-tolerance trade-off did not occur; and (4) phylogenetic control was necessary to measure the slow-quick continuum, resistance, and tolerance. These results support the conclusion that HDT's main influence on host contributions to transmission is via resistance. More broadly, this study provides a framework for quantifying HDT's influence on host contributions to transmission.},

  abstract = {Abstract Parasite prevalence shows tremendous spatiotemporal variation. Theory indicates that this variation might stem from life-history characteristics of parasites and key ecological factors. Here, we illustrate how the interaction of an important predator and the schedule of transmission potential of two parasites can explain parasite abundance. A field survey showed that a noncastrating fungus (Metschnikowia bicuspidata) commonly infected a dominant zooplankton host (Daphnia dentifera), while a castrating bacterial parasite (Pasteuria ramosa) was rare. This result seemed surprising given that the bacterium produces many more infectious propagules (spores) than the fungus upon host death. The fungus's dominance can be explained by the schedule of within-host growth of parasites (i.e., how transmission potential changes over the course of infection) and the release of spores from "sloppy" predators (Chaoborus spp., who consume Daphnia prey whole and then later regurgitate the carapace and parasite spores). In essence, sloppy predators create a niche that the faster-schedule fungus currently occupies. However, a selection experiment showed that the slower-schedule bacterium can evolve into this faster-schedule, predator-mediated niche (but pays a cost in maximal spore yield to do so). Hence, our study shows how parasite life history can interact with predation to strongly influence the ecology, epidemiology, and evolution of infectious disease.},

  abstract = {Abstract The persistence of sexual reproduction is a classic problem in evolutionary biology. The problem stems from the fact that, all else equal, asexual lineages should rapidly replace coexisting sexual individuals due to the cost of producing males in sexual populations. One possible countervailing advantage to sexual reproduction is that, on average, outcrossed offspring are more resistant than common clones to coevolving parasites, as predicted under the Red Queen hypothesis. In this study, we evaluated the prevalence of infection by a sterilizing trematode (Microphallus sp.) in a natural population of freshwater snails that was composed of both sexual and asexual individuals (Potamopyrgus antipodarum). More specifically, we compared the frequency of infection in sexual and asexual individuals over a 5-year period at four sites at a natural glacial lake (Lake Alexandrina, South Island, New Zealand). We found that at most sites and over most years, the sexual population was less infected than the coexisting asexual population. Moreover, the frequency of uninfected sexual females was periodically greater than two times the frequency of uninfected asexual females. These results give clear support for a fluctuating parasite-mediated advantage to sexual reproduction in a natural population.},

  doi = {10.1086/676643},
  abstract = {Abstract Community-level resilience depends on the interaction between multiple populations that vary in individual responses to disturbance. For example, in tropical reefs, some corals can survive higher stress (resistance) while others exhibit faster recovery (engineering resilience) following disturbances such as thermal stress. While each type will negatively affect the other through competition, each might also benefit the other by reducing the potential for an additional competitor such as macroalgae to invade after a disturbance. To determine how community composition affects ecological resilience, we modeled coral-macroalgae interactions given either a resistant coral, a resilient coral, or both together. Having both coral types (i.e., response diversity) can lead to observable enhanced ecological resilience if (1) the resilient coral is not a superior competitor and (2) disturbance levels are high enough such that the resilient coral would collapse when considered alone. This enhanced resilience occurs through competitor-enabled rescue where each coral increases the potential for the other to recover from disturbance through external recruitment, such that both corals benefit from the presence of each other in terms of total cover and resilience. Therefore, conservation management aimed at protecting resilience under global change requires consideration of both diversity and connectivity between sites experiencing differential disturbance.},

Leaf litter and soil samples were obtained from plots invaded by I. glandulifera since six years, from plots in which the invasive plant had been removed for four years and from plots which were not yet colonized by the invasive plant. The 45 leaf litter and soil samples were equally distributed over three forest areas, which were differently affected by a wind throw 12 years prior to sampling representing a natural gradient of disturbance. Collembola species richness and abundance in the leaf litter and soil samples were not affected by the presence of the invasive plant. However, the species composition of Collembola was altered in plots with I. glandulifera. The abundance of leaf-litter dwelling Acari was increased in invaded plots compared to the two other plot types. Furthermore, the presence of the invasive plant shifted the composition of Acari individuals belonging to different groups. Our field experiment demonstrates that an annual invasive plant can affect microarthropods which are important for nutrient cycling in various ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Chytridiomycosis, caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), is a widespread disease of amphibians responsible for population declines and extinctions. Some bacteria from amphibians' skins produce antimicrobial substances active against Bd. Supplementing populations of these cutaneous antifungal bacteria might help manage chytridiomycosis in wild amphibians. However, the activity of protective bacteria may depend upon environmental conditions. Biocontrol of Bd in nature thus requires knowledge of how environmental conditions affect their anti-Bd activity. For example, Bd-driven amphibian declines have often occurred at temperatures below Bd's optimum range. It is possible these declines occurred due to reduced anti-Bd activity of bacterial symbionts at cool temperatures. Better understanding of the effects of temperature on chytridiomycosis development could also improve risk evaluation for amphibian populations yet to encounter Bd. We characterized, at a range of temperatures approximating natural seasonal variation, the anti-Bd activity of bacterial symbionts from the skins of three species of rainforest tree frogs (Litoria nannotis, Litoria rheocola, and Litoria serrata). All three species declined during chytridiomycosis outbreaks in the late 1980s and early 1990s and have subsequently recovered to differing extents. We collected anti-Bd bacterial symbionts from frogs and cultured the bacteria at constant temperatures from 8$^\circ$C to 33$^\circ$C. Using a spectrophotometric assay, we monitored Bd growth in cell-free supernatants (CFSs) from each temperature treatment. CFSs from 11 of 24 bacteria showed reduced anti-Bd activity in vitro when they were produced at cool temperatures similar to those encountered by the host species during population declines. Reduced anti-Bd activity of metabolites produced at low temperatures may, therefore, partially explain the association between Bd-driven declines and cool temperatures. We show that to avoid inconsistent antifungal activity, bacteria evaluated for use in chytridiomycosis biocontrol should be tested over a range of environmental temperatures spanning those likely to be encountered in the field.},

We develop a framework to determine the optimal sampling strategy for disease detection in zoonotic host-vector epidemiological systems when a disease goes from below detectable levels to an epidemic. We find that if the time of disease introduction is known then the optimal sampling strategy can switch abruptly between sampling only from the vector population to sampling only from the host population. We also construct time-independent optimal sampling strategies when conducting periodic sampling that can involve sampling both the host and the vector populations simultaneously. Both time-dependent and -independent solutions can be useful for sampling design, depending on whether the time of introduction of the disease is known or not. We illustrate the approach with West Nile virus, a globally-spreading zoonotic arbovirus. Though our analytical results are based on a linearization of the dynamical systems, the sampling rules appear robust over a wide range of parameter space when compared to nonlinear simulation models. Our results suggest some simple rules that can be used by practitioners when developing surveillance programs. These rules require knowledge of transition rates between epidemiological compartments, which population was initially infected, and of the cost per sample for serological tests.},

To address this limitation, we adopt a Bayesian nonparametric approach to jointly modeling multivariate spatial binary data by integrating both types of correlations. A multivariate probit model is employed to link the binary outcomes to Gaussian latent variables; and Gaussian processes are applied to specify the spatially correlated random effects.

  abstract = {Over the past 50 years, human agents of deforestation have changed in ways that have potentially important implications for conservation efforts. We characterized these changes through a meta-analysis of case studies of land-cover change in the tropics. From the 1960s to the 1980s, small-scale farmers, with state assistance, deforested large areas of tropical forest in Southeast Asia and Latin America. As globalization and urbanization increased during the 1980s, the agents of deforestation changed in two important parts of the tropical biome, the lowland rainforests in Brazil and Indonesia. Well-capitalized ranchers, farmers, and loggers producing for consumers in distant markets became more prominent in these places and this globalization weakened the historically strong relationship between local population growth and forest cover. At the same time, forests have begun to regrow in some tropical uplands. These changing circumstances, we believe, suggest two new and differing strategies for biodiversity conservation in the tropics, one focused on conserving uplands and the other on promoting environmental stewardship in lowlands and other areas conducive to industrial agriculture.},

We quantified the impact of the ephemeral forest disturbance caused by gypsy moth canopy defoliation on exotic plant invasion in eight hardwood forests in the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area, USA. Six years following the gypsy moth disturbance, we were able to predict 59\% of the increase in Alliaria petiolata abundance and 42\% of the increase in Microstegium vimineum abundance with models incorporating an interaction between disturbance severity and propagule pressure. In addition, we found that the disturbance timing had substantial impacts on the invasion dynamics of Alliaria petiolata.

Evaluating the effects of multiple heterogeneities on predictions may help in quantifying prediction uncertaintie. In this study we investigated the effects of three levels of environmental heterogeneity on landscape-scale predictions. In addition, we analyzed how seed dispersal and interspecies competition contributes to prediction uncertainty. We used a coupled ecosystem and landscape modeling approach to predict tree species' abundance at the landscape scale. We designed multiple-species and single-species scenarios, each with the three levels of environmental heterogeneity. Our results showed the importance of considering environmental heterogeneity when predictioning tree species' abundance. For early-successional species landscape-scale predictions differed significantly among heterogeneity levels. For late-successional species, prediction uncertainties based on different heterogeneity levels were comparatively low. Seed dispersal may be a source of variation in predictions, whereas interspecies competition may reduce such variation.},

  abstract = {Forest insect pest disturbance is increasing in certain areas of North America as many insect species, such as the southern pine beetle, expand their range due to a warming climate. Because insect pests are beginning to occupy forests that are managed for multiple uses and have not been managed for pests before, it is becoming increasingly important to determine how forests should be managed for pests when non-timber ecosystem services are considered in addition to traditional costs and revenues. One example of a service that is increasingly considered in forest management and that may affect forest pest management is carbon sequestration. This manuscript seeks to understand whether the incorporation of forest carbon sequestration into cost-benefit analysis of different forest pest management strategies affects the financially optimal strategy. We examine this question through a case study of the southern pine beetle (SPB) in a new area of SPB expansion, the New Jersey Pinelands National Reserve (NJPR). We utilize a forest ecology and economics model and include field data from the NJPR as well as outbreak probability statistics from previous years. We find under the majority of scenarios, incorporating forest carbon sequestration shifts the financially optimal SPB management strategy from preventative thinning toward no management or reactionary management in forest stands in New Jersey. These results contradict the current recommended treatment strategy for SPB and signify that the inclusion of multiple ecosystem services into a cost-benefit analysis may drastically alter which pest management strategy is economically optimal.},

Such evolutionary principles can be used to guide the formulation of sustainable disease management strategies which can minimize disease epidemics while simultaneously reducing pressure on pathogens to evolve increased infectivity and aggressiveness. To ensure agricultural sustainability, disease management programs that reflect the dynamism of pathogen population structure are essential and evolutionary biologists should play an increasing role in their design.},

Some give rise to Schwann cells after down-regulation of Phox2b. Others form parasympathetic ganglia after being guided to the site of ganglion formation by the nerves that carry preganglionic fibers, a parsimonious way of wiring the pathway.

This chapter presents a working defi nition of a telecoupled system, emphasizing the role of governance and institutional change in telecoupled interactions. The social, institutional, and ecological processes and conditions through which telecoupling emerges are described. The analysis of these relationships in land science demands both integrative and diverse epistemological perspectives and methods.

  title = {Using {{Fire Return Interval Departure}} ({{FRID}}) Analysis to Map Spatial and Temporal Changes in Fire Frequency on {{National Forest}} Lands in {{California}}},
  abstract = {In California, fire regimes and related ecosystem processes have been altered by land use practices associated with Euro-American settlement, and climate warming is exacerbating the magnitude and effects of these changes. Because of changing environmental baselines, restoration of narrowly defined historical conditions may no longer be an attainable or sustainable long-term management goal, but comparisons between historical and current fire regimes can assist managers in prioritizing areas for ecological restoration and other management actions. Fire return interval departure (FRID) analysis quantifies the difference between current and presettlement fire frequencies. We assessed FRID variability along geographic, climatic, and vegetation gradients in California on lands managed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service and three forest-dominated national parks, using two types of FRID metrics: percent FRID (PFRID), and the NPS-FRID index. Much of northern California north of the Tehachapi Mountains has missed multiple fire cycles owing to fire suppression, while southern California is characterized by large areas burning at higher frequencies than under presettlement conditions. PFRID exhibited a unimodal (hump-shaped) relationship to elevation across our study area. PFRID showed little relationship to precipitation in northwest California or the Sierra Nevada region, but it decreased with precipitation in southern California. PFRID trends with temperature were unimodal, reaching a maximum at temperatures that approximate the elevation of the mean freezing line in winter storms, which also marks the transition between moist mixed conifer and red fir in most of northern California. Low- and middle-elevation vegetation types supported the greatest departures from presettlement fire frequencies, with oak woodlands, yellow pine, and mixed-conifer forests missing the most fire cycles, and coastal fir, coastal sage scrub, and chaparral tending to experience shorter FRIs than under presettlement conditions. Our results help refine our understanding of departures from presettlement fire regimes across California, and provide a spatial basis for resource management and planning focused on ecological restoration and adaptation to climate change in a fire-prone region.},

  abstract = {In light of the dynamic nature of parasite host ranges and documented potential for rapid host shifts, the observed high host specificity of most parasites remains an ecological paradox. Different variants of host-use trade-offs have become a mainstay of theoretical explanations of the prevalence of host specialism, but empirical evidence for such trade-offs is rare. We propose an alternative theory based on basic features of the parasite life cycle: host selection and subsequent intrahost replication. We introduce a new concept of effective burst size that accounts for the fact that successful host selection does not guarantee intrahost replication. Our theory makes a general prediction that a parasite will expand its host range if its effective burst size is positive. An in silico model of bacteria-phage coevolution verifies our predictions and demonstrates that the tendency for relatively narrow host ranges in parasites can be explained even in the absence of trade-offs.},

  abstract = {Determining how widespread human-induced changes such as habitat loss, landscape fragmentation, and climate instability affect populations, communities, and ecosystems is one of the most pressing environmental challenges. Critical to this challenge is understanding how these changes are affecting the movement abilities and dispersal trajectories of organisms and what role conservation planning can play in promoting movement among remaining fragments of suitable habitat. Whereas evidence is mounting for how conservation strategies such as corridors impact animal movement, virtually nothing is known for species dispersed by wind, which are often mistakenly assumed to not be limited by dispersal. Here, we combine mechanistic dispersal models, wind measurements, and seed releases in a large-scale experimental landscape to show that habitat corridors affect wind dynamics and seed dispersal by redirecting and bellowing airflow and by increasing the likelihood of seed uplift. Wind direction interacts with landscape orientation to determine when corridors provide connectivity. Our results predict positive impacts of connectivity and patch shape on species richness of wind-dispersed plants, which we empirically illustrate using 12 y of data from our experimental landscapes. We conclude that habitat fragmentation and corridors strongly impact the movement of wind-dispersed species, which has community-level consequences.},

However, quantitative comparisons of the importance of biotic interactions relative to other drivers are rarely made at larger scales. Using a data set spanning 78 sites and five continents, we assessed the relative importance of biotic interactions and climate in determining plant diversity in alpine ecosystems dominated by nurse-plant cushion species. Climate variables related with water balance showed the highest correlation with richness at the global scale. Strikingly, although the effect of cushion species on diversity was lower than that of climate, its contribution was still substantial. In particular, cushion species enhanced species richness more in systems with inherently impoverished local diversity. Nurse species appear to act as a 'safety net' sustaining diversity under harsh conditions, demonstrating that climate and species interactions should be integrated when predicting future biodiversity effects of climate change.},

The potential to function as a pathogen reservoir can be influenced by host lifespan, geographic provenance and phylogeny. Yet, no study has identified factors that causally determine the reservoir potential of diverse host species. We propose the host physiological phenotype hypothesis, which predicts that hosts with short-lived, poorly defended, nutrient rich and high metabolism tissue have greater values for three epidemiological parameters that determine reservoir potential: host susceptibility to infection, competence to infect vectors and ability to support vector populations. We experimentally tested these predictions using a generalist vectored virus and six wild grass species. Host physiological phenotype explained why hosts differed in all three epidemiological parameters while host lifespan, provenance and phylogeny could not explain host competence. Thus, a single, general axis describing variation in host physiological phenotype may explain reservoir potential.},

Viewshed models can be used to calculate sky obstruction for any given location on or above a complex topographic surface. We have developed an algorithm for rapid calculation of intercepted solar radiation using a combination of viewshed analysis and a lookup table of irradiance from each sky direction. First, the angular distribution of sky obstruction is calculated for the location of interest and stored in a hemispherical coordinate system. Then lookup table values for all unobstructed sky directions are summed to determine total irradiance. Angle of incidence is accounted for using a cosine correction. The process can be repeated across a topographic surface to determine the /Spatial distribution of intercepted solar radiation. The results can be expressed as energy flux or as sky view factors. This lookup table approach accounts for anisotropic irradiance distributions and can treat different spectral bands separately. The same viewshed approach can be used for optimizing calculation of reflected radiation from topographic surfaces. This approach will be especially valuable for studies of ecological processes, by permitting assessment of topographic influences on energy balance and microclimate.},

Moreover, these regions include most terrestrial vertebrates with small geographical ranges. However, the connections between the CBD targets of protecting area and species are complex. Achieving both targets will be difficult because regions with the most plant species have only slightly more land protected than do those with fewer.},

  abstract = {Microalgae represent one of the most promising groups of candidate organisms for replacing fossil fuels with contemporary primary production as a renewable source of energy. Algae can produce many times more biomass per unit area than terrestrial crop plants, easing the competing demands for land with food crops and native ecosystems. However, several aspects of algal biology present unique challenges to the industrial-scale aquaculture of photosynthetic microorganisms. These include high susceptibility to invading aquatic consumers and weeds, as well as prodigious requirements for nutrients that may compete with the fertiliser demands of other crops. Most research on algal biofuel technologies approaches these problems from a cellular or genetic perspective, attempting either to engineer or select algal strains with particular traits. However, inherent functional trade-offs may limit the capacity of genetic selection or synthetic biology to simultaneously optimise multiple functional traits for biofuel productivity and resilience. We argue that a community engineering approach that manages microalgal diversity, species composition and environmental conditions may lead to more robust and productive biofuel ecosystems. We review evidence for trade-offs, challenges and opportunities in algal biofuel cultivation with a goal of guiding research towards intensifying bioenergy production using established principles of community and ecosystem ecology.},

  abstract = {Causal attribution of recent biological trends to climate change is complicated because non-climatic influences dominate local, short-term biological changes. Any underlying signal from climate change is likely to be revealed by analyses that seek systematic trends across diverse species and geographic regions; however, debates within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reveal several definitions of a 'systematic trend'. Here, we explore these differences, apply diverse analyses to more than 1,700 species, and show that recent biological trends match climate change predictions. Global meta-analyses documented significant range shifts averaging 6.1 km per decade towards the poles (or metres per decade upward), and significant mean advancement of spring events by 2.3 days per decade. We define a diagnostic fingerprint of temporal and spatial 'sign-switching' responses uniquely predicted by twentieth century climate trends. Among appropriate long-term/large-scale/multi-species data sets, this diagnostic fingerprint was found for 279 species. This suite of analyses generates 'very high confidence' (as laid down by the IPCC) that climate change is already affecting living systems.},

The specimens were mainly collected from the Iberian Peninsula (98.63\% of the data records), especially the northern region. The earliest specimen deposited in the collection dates back to 1950, while the 1980's and 2000's are the best-represented time periods. Between 1950 and 2009, 16, 604 Odonata specimens were deposited and are documented in the dataset. Approximately 20\% of the specimens belong to the families Coenagrionidae and Calopterygidae. Specimens include the holotype and paratypes of the Iberian subspecies Calopteryx haemorrhoidalis asturica Ocharan, 1983 and Sympetrum vulgatum ibericum Ocharan, 1985.

Although such complex interactions have been modeled, field experiments in natural ecosystems to investigate the importance of interactions between local and regional processes are rare, especially so in coastal marine seafloor habitats subjected to many types of disturbance. We conducted a defaunation experiment at eight subtidal sites, incorporating manipulation of habitat structure, to test the relative importance of local habitat features and colonist supply in influencing macrobenthic community recovery rate. Our sites varied in community composition, habitat characteristics, and hydrodynamic conditions, and we conducted the experiment in two phases, exposing defaunated plots to colonists during periods of either high or low larval colonist supply. In both phases of the experiment, five months after disturbance, we were able to develop models that explained a large proportion of variation in community recovery rate between sites. Our results emphasize that the connectivity to the regional species pool influences recovery rate, and although local habitat effects were important, the strength of these effects was affected by broader-scale site characteristics and connectivity. Empirical evidence that cross-scale interactions are important in disturbance-recovery dynamics emphasizes the complex dynamics underlying seafloor community responses to cumulative disturbance.},

  abstract = {The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) aims at the conservation of all three levels of biodiversity, that is, ecosystems, species and genes. Genetic diversity represents evolutionary potential and is important for ecosystem functioning. Unfortunately, genetic diversity in natural populations is hardly considered in conservation strategies because it is difficult to measure and has been hypothesised to co-vary with species richness. This means that species richness is taken as a surrogate of genetic diversity in conservation planning, though their relationship has not been properly evaluated. We tested whether the genetic and species levels of biodiversity co-vary, using a large-scale and multi-species approach. We chose the high-mountain flora of the Alps and the Carpathians as study systems and demonstrate that species richness and genetic diversity are not correlated. Species richness thus cannot act as a surrogate for genetic diversity. Our results have important consequences for implementing the CBD when designing conservation strategies.},

Determinants were subjectively weighted according to their perceived relative importance before combining them to produce a risk-map of fasciolosis. The model estimates that 28\% of Cambodia is potentially at risk of fasciolosis with areas of high and moderate risk concentrated in southern and central Cambodia. The estimates of risk reflect the actual prevalence of fasciolosis in most districts surveyed, suggesting that the epidemiological determinants and weightings used to produce the model were appropriate. These results will be progressively refined as more detailed field surveys are completed to fully validate the model.},

  volume = {22},
  issn = {1051-0761},
  abstract = {There is conflicting evidence about the importance of urban soils and vegetation in regional C budgets that is caused, in part, by inconsistent definitions of "urban" land use. We quantified urban ecosystem contributions to C stocks in the Boston (Massachusetts, USA) Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) using several alternative urban definitions. Development altered aboveground and belowground C and N stocks, and the sign and magnitude of these changes varied by land use and development intensity. Aboveground biomass (live trees, dbh  or = 5 cm) for the MSA was 7.2 +/- 0.4 kg C/m2 (mean +/- SE), reflecting a high proportion of forest cover. Vegetation C was highest in forest (11.6 +/- 0.5 kg C/m2), followed by residential (4.6 +/- 0.5 kg C/m2), and then other developed (2.0 +/- 0.4 kg C/m2) land uses. Soil C (0-10 cm depth) followed the same pattern of decreasing C concentration from forest, to residential, to other developed land uses (4.1 +/- 0.1, 4.0 +/- 0.2, and 3.3 +/- 0.2 kg C/m2, respectively). Within a land use type, urban areas (which we defined as  25\% impervious surface area [ISA] within a 1-km(2) moving window) generally contained less vegetation C, but slightly more soil C, than nonurban areas. Soil N concentrations were higher in urban areas than nonurban areas of the same land use type, except for residential areas, which had similarly high soil N concentrations. When we compared our definition of urban to other commonly used urban extents (U.S. Census Bureau, Global Rural-Urban Mapping Project [GRUMP], and the MSA itself), we found that urban soil (1 m depth) and vegetation C stocks spanned a wide range, from 14.4 +/- 0.8 to 54.5 +/- 3.4 Tg C and from 4.2 +/- 0.4 to 27.3 +/- 3.2 Tg C, respectively. Conclusions about the importance of urban soils and vegetation to regional C and N stocks are very sensitive to the definition of urban used by the investigators. Urban areas, regardless of definition, are rapidly expanding in their extent; a systematic understanding of how our development patterns influence ecosystems is necessary to inform future development choices.},

The ``passenger'' model predicts that invaded communities are primarily structured by noninteractive factors (environmental change, dispersal limitation) that are less constraining on the exotics, which thus dominate. We tested these alternative hypotheses in an invaded, fragmented, and fire-suppressed oak savanna. We examined the impact of two invasive dominant perennial grasses on community structure using a reduction (mowing of aboveground biomass) and removal (weeding of above- and belowground biomass) experiment conducted at different seasons and soil depths.

We used a genome-wide approach to uncover sex-specific parent-of-origin allelic effects in the adult mouse brain. Our study identified preferential selection of the maternally inherited X chromosome in glutamatergic neurons of the female cortex. Moreover, analysis of the cortex and hypothalamus identified 347 autosomal genes with sex-specific imprinting features. In the hypothalamus, sex-specific imprinted genes were mostly found in females, which suggests parental influence over the hypothalamic function of daughters. We show that interleukin-18, a gene linked to diseases with sex-specific prevalence, is subject to complex, regional, and sex-specific parental effects in the brain. Parent-of-origin effects thus provide new avenues for investigation of sexual dimorphism in brain function and disease.},

  abstract = {GIS data processing and spatial analysis, together with modern decision analysis techniques, were used in this study to improve habitat suitability evaluation over large areas. Both empirical evaluation models and models based on expert knowledge can be applied in this approach. The habitat requirements of species were described as map layers within GIS so that each map layer represented one criterion. GIS was used as the platform in managing, combining and displaying the criterion data and also as a tool for producing new data, especially by utilising spatial analysis functions. Criterion standardisation, weighting and combining were accomplished by means of multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) methods, the theoretical background being based on the multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT). By using continuous priority and sub-priority functions in the evaluation, no classification of continuous attributes was needed and also non-linear relationships between habitat suitability and the attributes could be considered. Sensitivity analysis was applied to consider the temporal factor in the analysis and to find out the effect of different criteria weights on the spatial pattern of the suitability index. Changing the weights of permanent and time-changeable habitat factors shifted the location of optimal habitats for the species. In the long run, permanent factors such as soil properties define the habitat potential, which is important to take into consideration; e.g. in forest management planning and species conservation. The method is illustrated by a case study in which habitat suitability maps were produced for an old-forest polypore, Skeletocutis odora. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

  abstract = {Question: Predictive models constitute an important tool in multiple ecological applications. In this paper, we examine and compare the performance of six state-of-the-art methods commonly used in ecological modelling: Multiple Logistic Regression (MLR), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Maximum Entropy (MAXENT) and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS). Location: Northern Spain. Methods: We used presence/absence data of 15 plant species of an alpine rangeland in northern Spain and 14 topographical and geomorphological descriptors to build the models. We used leave-one-out cross validation on each model and computed the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and the resolution and calibration diagrams of the resulting probabilistic predictions. We also analysed the binary presence/absence deterministic predictions and computed the corresponding confusion matrices to calculate sensitivity, specificity, Cohen's kappa and the True Skill Statistic (TSS). Results: In general, CART and MAXENT showed poor performance and MLR was competitive with the more sophisticated ANN, MARS and SVM methods. The best predictive resolution was obtained, in most cases, by ANN followed by SVM and CART models; however, MLR and MARS were generally the best calibrated. The MAXENT predictions attained, in general, poor resolution and moderate to good calibration. Conclusion: Assessment of model calibration and resolution, in addition to ROC and confusion matrix-derived indices, is an important step for model choice depending on the final aim. Most of the target species were accurately predicted showing that the variables used are suitable descriptors at the scale of analysis.},

We tested the hypothesis that maximum taxon richness of macroinvertebrates will occur in communities subject to intermediate levels of disturbance at 54 stream sites that differed in the frequency and intensity of flood-related episodes of bed movement. Our results support the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, with both highly mobile and relatively sedentary taxa conforming to the predicted bell-shaped curve. Taxon richness was not related to habitat area (stream width), distance from the headwater, or the diversity of microhabitats (particle size categories) but was significantly and negatively related to the proportion of the substratum made up of small particles. Of all the factors measured, however, bed disturbance was by far the best at accounting for variation in taxonomic richness. We also quantified several kinds of potential refugia for invertebrates and found a positive relationship between richness and a refugia axis that combines amount of dead space with proportion of large substratum particles.},

The final model aims at minimizing costs of protecting predetermined numbers of common species while all critical species remain covered and buffered. These models are implemented for occurrence data of terrestrial mammals in Oregon. They enable, among other things, a comparison between the budgetary impacts of reserve networks with and without buffering rings for critical species, and a determination of the marginal cost of common species protection.},

Yet the mechanisms that produce the relationship between NDVI and species richness remain unclear because of correlated biotic and abiotic factors that influence NDVI. In this study we investigated different biotic and abiotic effects that potentially drive plant species richness\textendash{}productivity relationships. Location Hawaiian Islands, USA. Methods We quantified woody plant species richness, structure (density, basal area and canopy height), and species composition along a precipitation gradient of 14 Hawaiian dry forest plots. We then used structural equation models combined with 10 years of satellite data to disentangle the effects of precipitation, structure and NDVI-estimated productivity on species richness. Results Underlying the simple correlation between NDVI and species richness was the indirect effect of precipitation and direct effect of forest structure. The best-fit model showed there was no direct effect of NDVI on species richness. Main conclusions Our results demonstrate that complex relationships drive simple correlations between species richness and productivity. Considering the mechanisms and underlying factors driving NDVI\textendash{}species richness relationships could improve predictions of species diversity as satellite measures of productivity have an increasingly important role in habitat mapping, species distribution modelling and predictions for global change.},

  abstract = {The stimulation of plant growth by elevated CO2 concentration has been widely observed. Such fertilization, and associated carbon storage, could dampen future increases in atmospheric CO2 levels and associated climate warming1. However, the CO2 fertilization of plant biomass may be sensitive to nitrogen supply2\textendash{}4. Herein we show that in the latest decade of a long-term perennial grassland experiment, low ambient soil nitrogen availability constrained the positive response of plant biomass to elevated CO2, a result not seen in the first years (1998\textendash{}2000) of the study. From 2001 to 2010, elevated CO2 stimulated plant biomass half as much under ambient as under enriched nitrogen supply, an effect mirrored over this period by more positive effects of elevated CO2 on soil nitrogen supply (net nitrogen mineralization) and plant nitrogen status under enriched than ambient nitrogen supply. The results did not strongly support either the progressive nitrogen limitation hypothesis, or the alternative hypothesis of priming of soil nitrogen release by elevated CO2. As nitrogen limitation to productivity is widespread, persistent nitrogen constraints on terrestrial responses to rising CO2 are probably pervasive. Further incorporation of such interactions into Earth system models is recommended to better predict future CO2 fertilization effects and impacts on the global carbon cycle.},

  abstract = {1. Introduced pests and pathogens are a major source of disturbance to ecosystems world-wide. The famous examples have produced dramatic reductions in host abundance, including virtual extirpation, but most introductions have more subtle impacts that are hard to quantify but are potentially at least as important due to the pathogens' effects on host reproduction, competitive ability and stress tolerance. A general outcome could be reduced host abundance with concomitant increases in the abundance of competitors. 2. Beech bark disease (BBD) is a widespread, fatal affliction of American beech (Fagus grandifolia), currently present in c. 50\% of beech's distribution in eastern North America. Despite high adult mortality, beech remains a dominant component of the forest community. 3. Employing spatially extensive data from the national Forest Inventory and Analysis program of the United States Forest Service, we show that forests have changed dramatically in the presence of BBD. Within the 2.3 million km(2) range of beech, size-specific mortality was 65\% higher in the longest-infected regions, and large beech (90 cm diameter at breast height) have declined from c. 79 individuals km(-2) to being virtually absent. Small stem beech density was dramatically higher (350\%) such that infested forests contain a roughly equivalent cross-sectional (basal) area of beech as before BBD. 4. There was no evidence for compensation by sugar maple or other co-occurring tree species via increased recruitment or adult survivorship at the landscape scale. Overall, community composition remained roughly unchanged as a result of BBD. 5. Surprisingly, trajectory of stand dynamics (shifts in stem density and mean tree size reflecting normal stand maturation (self-thinning) or retrogression (more abundant, smaller trees over time)) did not differ between affected and unaffected regions. Variance in stand dynamics was greater in afflicted forests, however, indicating that predictability of forest structure has been diminished by BBD. 6. Synthesis. Forests of eastern North America have shifted to increased density and dramatically smaller stature without notable change in tree species composition following the invasion of a novel forest disease. Our results reinforce the conclusion that introduced diseases alter fundamental properties of ecosystems, but indicate that the spectrum of potential effects is broader than generally appreciated.},

  doi = {10.1073/pnas.0701257104},
  abstract = {Wide geographic range is generally thought to buffer taxa against extinction, but the strength of this effect has not been investigated for the great majority of the fossil record. Although the majority of genus extinctions have occurred between major mass extinctions, little is known about extinction selectivity regimes during these ``background'' intervals. Consequently, the question of whether selectivity regimes differ between background and mass extinctions is largely unresolved. Using logistic regression, we evaluated the selectivity of genus survivorship with respect to geographic range by using a global database of fossil benthic marine invertebrates spanning the Cambrian through the Neogene periods, an interval of $\approx$500 My. Our results show that wide geographic range has been significantly and positively associated with survivorship for the great majority of Phanerozoic time. Moreover, the significant association between geographic range and survivorship remains after controlling for differences in species richness and abundance among genera. However, mass extinctions and several second-order extinction events exhibit less geographic range selectivity than predicted by range alone. Widespread environmental disturbance can explain the reduced association between geographic range and extinction risk by simultaneously affecting genera with similar ecological and physiological characteristics on global scales. Although factors other than geographic range have certainly affected extinction risk during many intervals, geographic range is likely the most consistently significant predictor of extinction risk in the marine fossil record.},

  abstract = {Simulation models that describe autonomous individual organisms (individual based models, IBM) or agents (agent-based models, ABM) have become a widely used tool, not only in ecology, but also in many other disciplines dealing with complex systems made up of autonomous entities. However, there is no standard protocol for describing such simulation models, which can make them difficult to understand and to duplicate. This paper presents a proposed standard protocol, ODD, for describing IBMs and ABMs, developed and tested by 28 modellers who cover a wide range of fields within ecology. This protocol consists of three blocks (Overview, Design concepts, and Details), which are subdivided into seven elements: Purpose, State variables and scales, Process overview and scheduling, Design concepts, Initialization, Input, and Submodels. We explain which aspects of a model should be described in each element, and we present an example to illustrate the protocol in use. In addition, 19 examples are available in an Online Appendix. We consider ODD as a first step for establishing a more detailed common format of the description of IBMs and ABMs. Once initiated, the protocol will hopefully evolve as it becomes used by a sufficiently large proportion of modellers. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {A major problem worldwide is the potential loss of fisheries, forests, and water resources. Understanding of the processes that lead to improvements in or deterioration of natural resources is limited, because scientific disciplines use different concepts and languages to describe and explain complex social-ecological systems (SESs). Without a common framework to organize findings, isolated knowledge does not cumulate. Until recently, accepted theory has assumed that resource users will never self-organize to maintain their resources and that governments must impose solutions. Research in multiple disciplines, however, has found that some government policies accelerate resource destruction, whereas some resource users have invested their time and energy to achieve sustainability. A general framework is used to identify 10 subsystem variables that affect the likelihood of self-organization in efforts to achieve a sustainable SES.},

The integrated habitat suitability index approach includes the steps of constructing habitat suitability models, producing data needed in models, evaluating of target areas based on habitat factors, and combining various suitability indices. The method relies on the combined use of empirical evaluation models and models based on expertise in geographical information system (GIS) environment. GIS was used to produce the data needed in the models, and as a platform to execute the models and to present the results of the analysis. Furthermore, multi-criteria evaluation methods (MCEs) provide the technical tools for modeling the expertise and for connecting (standardizing, weighting, and combining) the habitat needs of different species. The main advantages of the method were connected to possibilities to consider the habitat factors on different scales, to combine habitat suitability evaluations for several species and to weight different species in different ways, and to integrate empirical models and expert knowledge. The method is illustrated by a case study in which an integrated habitat suitability map is produced for a group of old-forest species. \textcopyright{} 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Spatially-explicit population models allow a link between demography and the landscape. We developed a spatially-explicit simulation model for the red-cockaded woodpecker, Picoides borealis, an endangered and territorial cooperative breeder endemic to the southeastern United States. This kind of model is especially appropriate for this species because it can incorporate the spatial constraints on dispersal of helpers, and because territory locations are predictable. The model combines demographic data from a long-term study with a description of the spatial location of territories. Sensitivity analysis of demographic parameters revealed that population stability was most sensitive to changes in female breeder mortality, mortality of female dispersers and the number of fledglings produced per brood. Population behavior was insensitive to initial stage distribution; reducing the initial number of birds by one-half had a negligible effect. Most importantly, we found that the spatial distribution of territories had as strong an effect on response to demographic stochasticity as territory number. Populations were stable when territories were highly aggregated, with as few as 49 territories. When territories were highly dispersed, more than 169 territories were required to achieve stability. Model results indicate the importance of considering the spatial distribution of territories in management plans, and suggest that this approach is worthy of further development.},

  abstract = {1. Structural diversity and niche differences within habitats are important for stabilizing species coexistence. However, land-use change leading to environmental homogenization is a major cause for the dramatic decline of biodiversity under global change. The difficulty in assessing large-scale biodiversity losses urgently requires new technological advances to evaluate land-use impact on diversity timely and efficiently across space. 2. While cost-effective aerial images have been suggested for potential biodiversity assessments in forests, correlation of canopy object variables such as gaps with plant or animal diversity has so far not been demonstrated using these images. 3. Here, we show that aerial images of canopy gaps can be used to assess floristic biodiversity of the forest understorey. This approach is made possible because we employed cutting-edge unmanned aerial vehicles and very high-resolution images (7~cm~pixel-1) of the canopy properties. We demonstrate that detailed, spatially implicit information on gap shape metrics is sufficient to reveal strong dependency between disturbance patterns and plant diversity (R2 up to 0\textperiodcentered{}74). This is feasible because opposing disturbance patterns such as aggregated and dispersed tree retention directly correspond to different functional and dispersal traits of species and ultimately to different species diversities. 4. Our findings can be used as a coarse-filter approach to conservation in forests wherever light strongly limits regeneration and biodiversity.},

IBMs are now used in almost all subfields of ecology and evolutionary biology. We map those subfields and look more closely at selected key papers on fish recruitment, forest dynamics, sympatric speciation, metapopulation dynamics, maintenance of diversity, and species conservation. Theorists are currently divided on whether IBMs represent only a practical tool for extending classical theory to more complex situations, or whether individual-based theory represents a radically new research program.

Interactions among animals, and between animals and the environments that they traverse, play an important role in the development of the complex ecological and social systems in which they are embedded. Agent-based models have been increasingly applied as a computational approach to the study of animal movement across landscapes. In this article, we present a review of agent-based models in which the simulation of animal movement processes and patterns is the central theme. Our discussion of these processes is focused on four key components: internal states, external factors, motion capacities, and navigation capacities. These four components have been identified in the emerging movement ecology research paradigm and are important for modeling animal movement behavior. Because agent-based models allow for an individual-based approach that encapsulates these four components, the underlying processes that drive animal behavior can be deeply explored using this technique. A set of challenges and issues remain, however, for agent-based models of animal movement. In this article, we review the existing literature and identify potential research directions that could help address these challenges.},

He argues that bottom-up processes -- in which the outcomes are always uncertain -- can combine with new forms of geometry associated with fractal patterns and chaotic dynamics to provide theories that are applicable to highly complex systems such as cities.br / br / Batty begins with models based on cellular automata (CA), simulating urban dynamics through the local actions of automata.

Finally, Batty develops applications of all these models to specific urban situations, discussing concepts of criticality, threshold, surprise, novelty, and phase transition in the context of spatial developments.

Some who write on this topic suggest that complexity theory will lead to a unifying understanding of complex phenomena; others dismiss it as a passing and disruptive fad. We suggest that for the analysis of coupled natural/human systems, the truth emerges from the middle ground. As an approach focused as much on the connections among system elements as the elements themselves, we argue that complexity theory provides a useful conceptual framework for the study of coupled natural/human systems. It is, if nothing else, a framework that leads us to ask interesting questions about, for example, sustainability, resilience, threshold events, and predictability. In this paper we attempt to demystify the ongoing discussions on complexity theory by linking its evocative and overloaded terminology to real-world processes. We illustrate how a shift in focus from system elements to connections among elements can lead to meaningful insight into human\textendash{}environment interactions that might otherwise be overlooked. We ground our discussion in ongoing interdisciplinary research surrounding Yellowstone National Park's northern elk winter range; a tightly coupled natural/human system that has been the center of debate, conflict, and compromise for more than 135 years.},

The initial phase of research on nonlinear systems focused on deterministic chaos, but more recent studies have investigated the properties of self-organizing systems or anti-chaos. For mathematicians and physicists, the biggest surprise is that complexity lurks within extremely simple systems. For biologists, it is the idea that natural selection is not the sole source of order in the biological world.

That is, how do we develop reusable models of how system dynamics arise from characteristics of individuals? What conceptual framework do we use when the classical differential equation framework no longer applies? An extensive review illustrates the ecological problems that have been addressed with individual-based models. The authors then identify how the mechanics of building and using individual-based models differ from those of traditional science, and provide guidance on formulating, programming, and analyzing models. This book will be helpful to ecologists interested in modeling, and to other scientists interested in agent-based modeling./p\}},

  abstract = {Each modeller who builds and analyses an individual-based model learns of course a great deal, but what has ecology as a whole learned from the individual-based models published during the last decade? Answering this question proves extremely difficult as there is no common motivation behind individual-based models. The distinction is introduced between `pragmatic' motivation, which uses the individual-based approach as a tool without any reference to the theoretical issues which have emerged from the classical state variable approach and `paradigmatic' motivation, which explicitly refers to theoretical ecology. A mini-review of 50 individual-based animal population models shows that the majority are driven by pragmatic motivation. Most models are very complex and special techniques to cope with this complexity during their analysis are only occasionally applied. It is suggested that in order to orient individual-based modelling more towards general theoretical issues, we need increased explicit reference to theoretical ecology and an advanced strategy for building and analysing individual-based models. To this end, a heuristic list of rules is presented which may help us to advance the practice of individual-based modelling and to learn more general lessons from individual-based modelling in the future than we have during the last decade. The main ideas behind these rules are as follows: (1) Individual-based models usually make more realistic assumptions than state variable models, but it should not be forgotten that the aim of individual-based modelling is not `realism' but modelling. (2) The individual-based approach is a bottom-up approach which starts with the `parts' (i.e. individuals) of a system (i.e. population) and then tries to understand how the system's properties emerge from the interaction among these parts. However, bottom-up approaches alone will never lead to theories at the systems level. State variable or top-down approaches are needed to provide an appropriate integrated view, i.e. the relevant questions at the population level.},

Mobile taxa outnumbered sessile species by approximately 2:1, whereas sessile individuals were over 12 times as numerous as mobile ones over the entire study site. Patterns of density, richness and abundance differed with shore level and substratum. The results also highlighted the importance of clearly distinguishing between species density and species richness when examining spatially quantitative data. The rank order of habitats from highest to lowest species density was not the same when analysed in order of species richness. The potential for the mobile proportion of assemblages to influence small-scale diversity assessment through movement was greater at mid- and high-shore zones because the ratio of mobile species was higher and abundance (relative to the lower shore) was low. These observations might reflect the relative influence of the land\textendash{}sea gradient of immersion on diversity and mobility in intertidal communities. The influence of mobile organisms on marine ecosystem function may be significant because small-scale patterns of movement are known to positively influence biodiversity. High richness paired with low abundance, however, may result in underestimating the functional role of mobile intertidal species.},

In this paper we report results of a population model for the Northern Spotted Owl that incorporates both juvenile dispersal and search for mates. We analyze both deterministic and stochastic versions of the model in search of thresholds for population persistence related to search efficiency, population density, and amount of suitable habitat. In addition, we analyze the model under the nonequilibrium conditions that currently exist due to timber harvest in the owls' preferred habitat. Our results predict a sharp threshold below which populations cannot persist, and suggest that inferences from population models that incorporate equilibrium assumptions may be highly misleading.},

Effects of confluences on river morphology are conditioned by basin shape and channel network patterns, and they include the nonlinear separation of geomorphically significant confluences in river networks. Other modifying factors include local network geometry and drainage density. Confluence-related landforms (i.e., fans, bars, terraces, etc.) are predicted to be dominated by older features in headwaters and younger features downstream, a pattern driven by the frequency and magnitude of floods and punctuated sediment supply that scale with watershed size.},

  volume = {16},
  issn = {1051-0761},
  abstract = {While the importance of spatial scale in ecology is well established, few studies have investigated the impact of data grain on conservation planning outcomes. In this study, we compared species richness hotspot and representation networks developed at five grain sizes. We used species distribution maps for mammals and birds developed by the Arizona and New Mexico Gap Analysis Programs (GAP) to produce 1-km2, 100-kmn2, 625-km2, 2500-km2, and 10,000-km2 grid cell resolution distribution maps. We used these distribution maps to generate species richness and hotspot (95th quantile) maps for each taxon in each state. Species composition information at each grain size was used to develop two types of representation networks using the reserve selection software MARXAN. Reserve selection analyses were restricted to Arizona birds due to considerable computation requirements. We used MARXAN to create best reserve networks based on the minimum area required to represent each species at least once and equal area networks based on irreplaceability values. We also measured the median area of each species' distribution included in hotspot (mammals and birds of Arizona and New Mexico) and irreplaceability (Arizona birds) networks across all species. Mean area overlap between richness hotspot reserves identified at the five grain sizes was 29\% (grand mean for four within-taxon/state comparisons), mean overlap for irreplaceability reserve networks was 32\%, and mean overlap for best reserve networks was 53\%. Hotspots for mammals and birds showed low overlap with a mean of 30\%. Comparison of hotspots and irreplaceability networks showed very low overlap with a mean of 13\%. For hotspots, median species distribution area protected within reserves declined monotonically from a high of 11\% for 1-km2 networks down to 6\% for 10,000-km2 networks. Irreplaceability networks showed a similar, but more variable, pattern of decline. This work clearly shows that map resolution has a profound effect on conservation planning outcomes and that hotspot and representation outcomes may be strikingly dissimilar. Thus, conservation planning is scale dependent, such that reserves developed using coarse-grained data do not subsume fine-grained reserves. Moreover, preserving both full species representation and species rich areas may require combined reserve design strategies.},

  abstract = {Concepts of spatial scale, such as extent, grain, resolution, range, footprint, support and cartographic ratio are not interchangeable. Because of the potential confusion among the definitions of these terms, we suggest that authors avoid the term "scale" and instead refer to specific concepts. In particular, we are careful to discriminate between observation scales, scales of ecological phenomena and scales used in spatial statistical analysis. When scales of observation or analysis change, that is, when the unit size, shape, spacing or extent are altered, statistical results are expected to change. The kinds of results that may change include estimates of the population mean and variance, the strength and character of spatial autocorrelation and spatial anisotropy, patch and gap sizes and multivariate relationships. The first three of these results (precision of the mean, variance and spatial autocorrelation) can sometimes be estimated using geostatistical support-effect models. We present four case studies of organism abundance and cover illustrating some of these changes and how conclusions about ecological phenomena (process and structure) may be affected. We identify the influence of observational scale on statistical results as a subset of what geographers call the Modifiable Area Unit Problem (MAUP). The way to avoid the MAUP is by careful construction of sampling design and analysis. We recommend a set of considerations for sampling design to allow useful tests for specific scales of a phenomenon under study. We further recommend that ecological studies completely report all components of observation and analysis scales to increase the possibility of cross-study comparisons.},

Our results indicate that fine-scale snow albedo effects influence the response of both hot and cold events and that peak increases in extreme hot events are amplified by surface moisture feedbacks. Likewise, we find that extreme precipitation is enhanced on the lee side of rain shadows and over coastal areas dominated by convective precipitation. We project substantial, spatially heterogeneous increases in both hot and wet events over the contiguous United States by the end of the next century, suggesting that consideration of fine-scale processes is critical for accurate assessment of local- and regional-scale vulnerability to climate change.},

This paper argues that such an integration is possible, even between ecology and human geography, the subfield of geography seemingly most removed from ecological concerns and methods. In both disciplines, globalization has lent practical urgency to problems of scale, revealing deeper theoretical issues. Geographers have helped impel ecologists to take space and scale seriously, and the epistemological insight that scale is produced (rather than given a priori) should be applied to ecological as well as social phenomena. Ecologists' conceptual distinctions and methodological guidelines regarding scale, meanwhile, can help resolve ‘the scale question' in critical human geography. Scale is both a methodological issue inherent to observation (its epistemological moment) and an objective characteristic of complex interactions within and among social and natural processes (its ontological moment). These processes and interactions rather than scale per se should be the object of research, with particular attention to nonlinearities or thresholds of change.},

I used different threshold distances to calculate the degree of habitat connectivity. A threshold distance is the distance beyond which the probability of successfully bridging the distance by dispersing individuals is assumed to decrease rapidly. The sum of the degree of connectivity over all patches in a region provides a measure for the overall degree of connectivity. Based on this measure, I could first give an indication under what conditions species may experience effects of constrained dispersal in that region. Second, the degree of connectivity of the individual patches was related with the observed colonizations of these patches. The degree of habitat connectivity measured for threshold distances of ca 2.4-3 km best explains the colonization probability of unoccupied patches. These threshold distances give an indication of the distances covered by dispersing nuthatches that led to successful colonizations.},

The conservation network resulting from treating the region as one unit is compared with networks generated separately for the provinces nested in that region. These outcomes are evaluated in terms of (i) their land use efficiencies, (ii) their spatial overlap, and (iii) the impact of algorithm attributes. Although land use efficiencies are greater on broader scales, on average the spatial congruence between the broad-scale regional network and fine-scale provincial networks was 14\%. Algorithms using different selection rules fail to improve this disturbing outcome. Consequently, scale has an overwhelming influence on areas identified as conservation networks in geopolitical units. This should be recognized in conservation planning.},

In this study, we analyse patterns of species richness at the local (average alpha) and regional (gamma) scales, and the relationship between them (Whittaker's beta), in central Mexico, using as a source of data for the species' distributions: (1) museum specimen occurrence data for birds, and (2) distribution maps based on ecological niche models developed and refined by experts. We performed analyses at five spatial resolutions (1/32$^\circ$-1/2$^\circ$). Scale changes (grain and extent) affected significantly the estimates of average alpha, gamma, and beta. Use of raw occurrence data vs. distribution maps yielded contrasting results, with raw data underestimating alpha and overestimating beta, as functions of area. As regards species\textendash{}area relationships, our results suggest a natural decomposition of factors into an area-invariant component (related to alpha), and an area dependent factor (related to beta). Most of our results are maintained in a null model that randomizes occurrences without changing observed range-size distributions. From this result we argue that average alpha and Whittaker's beta capture little information about the spatial covariation of species distribution patterns.},

  abstract = {Abstract Over the past ten years the scientific basis for reserve selection and design have rapidly developed. This period has also been characterized by a shift in emphasis toward large spatial and organizational scales of conservation efforts. I discuss the evidence in support of this shift toward larger scale conservation by contrasting the success of fine-filter (genes, populations, species) conservation and coarse-filter (communities, habitats, ecosystems, landscapes) conservation. Conservation at both organizational scales has been successful and merits continued support, although fine-filter conservation is more straightforward. Ecological theory suggests that conservation at large scales is preferred. Despite this preference, both fine- and coarse-filter conservation objectives have been met by small reserves. In many landscapes there are no opportunities for the conservation of native species diversity that encompass a large spatial scale. Thus, reserve selection at any organizational scale may include conservation at a variety of spatial scales. A variety of methods have been suggested that integrate across scales of conservation. Some, such as umbrella, flagship, and indicator species, remain very problematic. Reserve selection algorithms and gap analyses, in contrast, offer promising opportunities to increase the efficiency of conservation at all scales.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY In this paper, I argue that the ultimate causes of morphological, and hence developmental, evolution are scale independent. In other words, micro- and macroevolutionary patterns show fundamental similarities and therefore are most simply explained as being caused by the same kinds of evolutionary forces. I begin by examining the evolution of single lineages and argue that dynamics of adaptive evolution are the same for bacteria in test-tube evolution experiments and fossil lineages. Similarly, I argue that the essential features of adaptive radiations large and small can be attributed to conventional forces such as mutation and diversifying natural selection due to competition. I then address recent claims that the molecular features of metazoan development are the result of clade-level selection for evolvability, and suggest that these features can be more easily explained by conventional individual-level selection for the suppression of deleterious pleiotropic effects. Finally, I ask what must be known if we are to understand the ultimate causes of molecular and developmental diversity.},

In this paper we critique the dominant - hierarchical - conception of scale, arguing it presents a number of problems that cannot be overcome simply by adding on to or integrating with network theorizing. We thereby propose to eliminate scale as a concept in human geography. In its place we offer a different ontology, one that so flattens scale as to render the concept unnecessary.

  abstract = {Frost is an important episodic event that damages plant tissues through the formation of ice crystals at or below freezing temperatures. In montane regions, where climate change is expected to cause earlier snow melt but may not change the last frost-free day of the year, plants that bud earlier might be directly impacted by frost through damage to flower buds and reproductive structures. However, the indirect effects of frost mediated through changes in plant\textendash{}pollinator interactions have rarely been explored. We examined the direct and pollinator-mediated indirect effects of frost on three wildflower species in southwestern Colorado, USA, Delphinium barbeyi (Ranunculaceae), Erigeron speciosus (Asteraceae), and Polemonium foliosissimum (Polemoniaceae), by simulating moderate (\`A1 to \`A5$^\circ$C) frost events in early spring in plants in situ. Subsequently, we measured plant growth, and upon flowering measured flower morphology and phenology. Throughout the flowering season, we monitored pollinator visitation and collected seeds to measure plant reproduction. We found that frost had species-specific direct and indirect effects. Frost had direct effects on two of the three species. Frost significantly reduced flower size, total flowers produced, and seed production of Erigeron. Furthermore, frost reduced aboveground plant survival and seed production for Polemonium. However, we found no direct effects of frost on Delphinium. When we considered the indirect impacts of frost mediated through changes in pollinator visitation, one species, Erigeron, incurred indirect, negative effects of frost on plant reproduction through changes in floral traits and pollinator visitation, along with direct effects. Overall, we found that flowering plants exhibited species-specific direct and pollinator-mediated indirect responses to frost, thus suggesting that frost may play an important role in affecting plant communities under climate change.},

In Europe the primary arthropod vectors of zoonotic diseases are ticks, which transmit Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (the agent of Lyme disease), tick-borne encephalitis virus and louping ill virus between humans, livestock and wildlife. Ixodes ricinus ticks and reported tick-borne disease cases are currently increasing in the UK. Theories for this include climate change and increasing host abundance. This study aimed to test how I. ricinus tick abundance might be inXuenced by climate change in Scotland by using altitudinal gradients as a proxy, while also taking into account the eVects of hosts, vegetation and weather eVects. It was predicted that tick abundance would be higher at lower altitudes (i.e. warmer climates) and increase with host abundance. Surveys were conducted on nine hills in Scotland, all of open moorland habitat. Tick abundance was positively associated with deer abundance, but even after taking this into account, there was a strong negative association of ticks with altitude. This was probably a real climate eVect, with temperature (and humidity, i.e. saturation deWcit) most likely playing an important role. It could be inferred that ticks may become more abundant at higher altitudes in response to climate warming. This has potential implications for pathogen prevalence such as louping ill virus if tick numbers increase at elevations where competent transmission hosts (red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus and mountain hares Lepus timidus) occur in higher numbers.},

Indices aim to describe general properties of communities that allow us to compare different regions, taxa, and trophic levels. Therefore, they are of fundamental importance for environmental monitoring and conservation, although there is no consensus about which indices are more appropriate and informative. We tested several common diversity indices in a range of simple to complex statistical analyses in order to determine whether some were better suited for certain analyses than others. We used data collected around the focal plant Plantago lanceolata on 60 temperate grassland plots embedded in an agricultural landscape to explore relationships between the common diversity indices of species richness (S), Shannon's diversity (H'), Simpson's diversity (D1), Simpson's dominance (D2), Simpson's evenness (E), and Berger\textendash{}Parker dominance (BP). We calculated each of these indices for herbaceous plants, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, aboveground arthropods, belowground insect larvae, and P. lanceolata molecular and chemical diversity. Including these trait-based measures of diversity allowed us to test whether or not they behaved similarly to the better studied species diversity. We used path analysis to determine whether compound indices detected more relationships between diversities of different organisms and traits than more basic indices. In the path models, more paths were significant when using H', even though all models except that with E were equally reliable. This demonstrates that while common diversity indices may appear interchangeable in simple analyses, when considering complex interactions, the choice of index can profoundly alter the interpretation of results. Data mining in order to identify the index producing the most significant results should be avoided, but simultaneously considering analyses using multiple indices can provide greater insight into the interactions in a system.},

Although the effects of fire on forage availability for deer have been studied, how female deer use burned areas is not well known, particularly as it relates to fire season and the years-since-fire. We used GPS tracking data from 16 adult female white-tailed deer to assess the effects of fire season and yearssince-fire on habitat use during summer lactation. Females selected unburned drainages and older ($>$1 yr-since-fire) burned areas, and avoided recently burned areas. Individuals with a greater percentage of their summer core area burned expanded the size of their summer home range but did not change summer core area size. Furthermore, summer core area site fidelity (i.e., \% overlap between 2011 and 2012 core areas) decreased as the percentage of the 2011 summer core area burned in 2012 increased. Female deer increased selection of burned areas as years-since-fire increased, likely because there was a temporary loss of cover immediately following fire with plants slowly regenerating the subsequent growing seasons. Likewise, to avoid areas depleted of cover, females shifted their core areas away from recent burns when possible but increased their core area size when burned areas were unavoidable (i.e., a large portion of their home range was burned). Burning large contiguous areas may initially have a negative effect on female deer during lactation because of the depletion of cover.},

  abstract = {Ecologists increasingly recognize the importance of trait-mediated indirect interactions and suggest behavioral traits aimed to reduce predation risk can induce trophic cascades. However, the application of theory developed in simple experimental systems to complex natural systems has spurred debate regarding whether predation risk, independent of direct killing, can structure ecosystems. We examined the effects of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) foraging under the risk of predation by coyotes on oak (Quercus spp.) regeneration and the abundance of palatable understory species in a frequently burned longleaf pine savanna. Oaks represent a common but relatively low quality forage item for deer, and are an important component of this system because oak encroachment into pine-dominated uplands can reduce biodiversity. In frequently burned ecosystems oaks and other fire-impeding species often exist in a demographic fire-trap, where they sprout following fire but rarely escape into the midstory, because they are repeatedly top-killed by subsequent fires. Many factor including herbivory stress can influence the probability of fire survival for oak saplings. Other Cervids, including elk (Cervus canadensis) and moose (Alces alces) are known to increase use of woody browse with predation risk because of selection for brushy areas that offer concealment cover. We experimentally manipulated predation risk for 10 years, by establishing 4 approximately 40-ha predator exclosures and 4 control plots to test the effects of predation risk on aspects of the plant community. Reduced predation risk resulted in increased oak recruitment and decreased abundance of palatable forage. A density-mediated trophic cascade does not explain the release of oaks and our results provide support the behaviorally-mediated trophic cascade hypothesis. We offer evidence that frequent disturbance can facilitate trophic cascades and that predatorsensitive foraging can enhance fire suppression of oaks and influence groundcover composition in longleaf pine savannas.},

We conducted a capture-mark-recapture study from April 1999 to April 2002 to examine experimentally the effect of prescribed fire, herbicide application and herbicide-prescribed fire combination on apparent survival rates of cotton mouse (Peromyscus gossypinus) and cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus) populations. There was no evidence that herbicide application affected survival of cotton mice. Evidence to support effects of prescribed fire and herbicide-fire combination on survival of cotton mice was weak, although apparent monthly survival generally increased after these treatments. There was strong evidence that prescribed fire and herbicide-fire treatments affected survival of cotton rats, but the evidence for the effect of herbicide alone on survival was weak; survival rates declined in response to all three treatments but most strongly in response to the prescribed fire treatment. Fire alone had a stronger effect than an herbicidefire treatment in both species. Without clear understanding of their ecological impacts, alternatives to prescribed fire should be employed with caution.},

  abstract = {Invasive exotic species pose significant challenges for natural resource managers charged with the maintenance of biological diversity and the sustainable production of forest resources. In this article, we review what is known about the biology and control of some of the most serious woody invaders of eastern forests. Based on the parallels between these invasions, we propose a working framework for integrating invasive control into forestry practices. In general, early detection and rapid response to invasions are essential. However, given that consistently effective control strategies that are broadly applicable simply do not exist for many species, adaptive management strategies will be necessary.},

  abstract = {As forest edges are a major source of heterogeneity in fragmented landscapes, the atmospheric flow over forested areas is often under their influence. Understanding how far the upstream edge has an impact on the turbulent wind flow in a forest canopy is important, in particular for scalar flux measurement. In this study, edge and stand flows over a maritime pine forest characterized by a dense crown layer located above a deep and sparse trunk space are analysed in detail from in situ measurements and large-eddy simulations (LES). The LES model used here appears to simulate remarkably well most characteristics of the turbulent wind flow for this particular canopy structure. It is shown that the main characteristics of the edge flow in this case differ from those usually observed in forests with a more uniform vertical foliage distribution. The main differences are (i) the development of turbulence above the canopy occurring closer to the edge, (ii) the absence of a well-defined enhanced gust zone around the top of the canopy, (iii) the presence of a large secondary wind maximum within the trunk space, and (iv) the development of a positive momentum flux layer below the crown layer. Most of these differences are related to the presence of a substantial sub-canopy wind jet induced by the wind flow through the trunk space at the edge. The secondary velocity maximum induced by this wind jet differs from that observed in homogeneous stand conditions, where it seems to be related to the mesoscale pressure gradient. The wind jet appears to decrease very slowly with distance from the edge, so that edge effects are still significant at 9h from the edge (where h is the mean canopy height). The length of the adjustment region is shown to be greater than 10\textendash{}15h, and to depend on the depth of the trunk space. In very fragmented forested areas with deep and sparse trunk space, within-canopy flow may always be under the influence of edges.},

Fire exclusion results in structural and compositional shifts that alter fuelbed composition and structure, together influencing fire behavior and effects. To clarify the influence of overstory structure on fuels and fire intensity in oak woodlands and savannas, we examined fuelbeds across a gradient from open grassland to Douglas-fir- (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) invaded Oregon white oak (Quercus garryana Douglas ex Hook.) woodland in the Bald Hills of Redwood National Park, California, USA. Herbaceous mass decreased markedly from a high in grasslands (3.38 Mg ha-1) to a low in invaded woodlands (0.03 Mg ha-1), whereas leaf litter and woody fuel mass increased substantially along this gradient. Mean fire temperatures at 30 cm height ranged from 74.7\,$^\circ$C in invaded woodland up to 207.9\,$^\circ$C in grassland. Highly flammable grassland and savanna communities maintain heavy herbaceous mass, but low woody mass, favoring quickspreading, relatively high-intensity fires. The encroachment of Douglas-fir into grasslands and oak-dominated communities dampens flammability through changes in fuelbed composition and structure (e.g., the replacement of herbaceous fuels with woody fuels), underscoring the necessity for ecological restoration efforts that focus on fuelbed structure in addition to other common restoration goals.},

  abstract = {A variety of techniques that estimate temperature and/or heat output during fires are available. We assessed the predictive ability of metal and tile pyrometers, calorimeters of different sizes, and fuel consumption to time-temperature metrics derived from thick and thin thermocouples at 140 points distributed over 9 management-scale burns in a longleaf pine forest in the southeastern US. While all of these devices underestimate maximum flame temperatures, we found several to be useful for characterizing other metrics of fire behavior. While the degree to which thermocouples underestimated maximum temperatures was based on thickness, metrics derived from thermocouple data that integrated time and temperature minimized this discrepancy between thin and thick thermocouples. Thermocouples also provided the most detailed spatial and temporal data of the devices tested. Pyrometers underestimated maximum temperatures relative to thermocouples, but due to their low cost, can be useful for examining spatial variation in temperature during fires. Use of calorimeters is disadvantageous given their lack of precision and high labor cost. Simple fire behavior observations taken during burns and indicators of fire severity observed post-burn were inexpensive to estimate and revealed useful differences among fires. Due to the wide variation among these techniques in cost, labor, accuracy, and level of detail of results, their suitability for a particular project will vary according to research objectives and available resources. Researchers should ensure that the fire behavior parameter measured has a logical relationship to the effect of interest, is measured at an appropriate level of detail, and is reported with attention to the limitations of the measuring devices used.},

Three study areas in southern Ohio oak-hickory (Quercus-Carya) forests were established with four treatment areas of $\sim$20 ha each: control (C), burn only (B), thin only (T) or thin plus burn (TB). Two independent measures useful for qualitatively characterising fire intensity were established on a 50-m grid, resulting in over 120 sampling locations at each site, in the burned areas: aluminum tags painted with temperature-sensitive paints, and logger-probe units that logged probe temperature every 2 s during burns. Fires were conducted in spring 2001. The logger-probe units allowed five measures qualitatively related to fire intensity or timing to be calculated at each grid point: maximum probe temperature; duration of probe temperature above 30$\smwhtcircle$C; a heat index, defined as the summed temperatures above 30$\smwhtcircle$C; time of maximum temperature; and estimated rate of spread. Maximum temperatures recorded by the two measuring systems were highly correlated (r2 = 0.83). Relative to painted tags, logger-probe units provide information useful for assessing some other components of fire behaviour. The temporal recording of temperatures allowed us to prepare a web-based simulation of the fires. Heat index and rate of spread estimates provided additional fire information. The TB units consistently burned cooler than the B units, perhaps because of uncured slash and a disrupted fuel bed in those units.},

  abstract = {Natural fires ignited by lightning strikes following droughts frequently are posited as the ecological mechanism maintaining discontinuous tree cover and grass-$\-$dominated ground layers in savannas. Such fires, however, may not reliably maintain humid savannas. We propose that savanna trees producing pyrogenic shed leaves might engineer fire characteristics, affecting ground-layer plants in ways that maintain humid savannas. We explored our $\-$hypothesis in a high-r$\-$ ainfall, frequently burned pine savanna in which the dominant tree, longleaf pine (Pinus palustris), produces resinous needles that become highly flammable when shed and dried. We postulated that pyrogenic needles should have much greater influence on fire characteristics at ground level, and hence post-f$\-$ire responses of dominant shrubs and grasses, than other abundant fine fuels (shed oak leaves and grass culms). We further reasoned that these effects should increase with amounts of needles. We managed site conditions that affect fuels (time since fire, dominant vegetation), manipulated amounts of needles in ground-$\-$layer plots, prescribed burned the plots, and measured fire characteristics at ground level. We also measured characteristics of ground-$\-$layer oaks and grasses before, then 2 and 8 months after fires. We tested our hypotheses regarding effects of pyrogenic pine fuels on fire characteristics and vegetation regrowth and explored direct and indirect effects of fuels on fire characteristics and vegetation using a structural equation model. Pine needles influenced fire characteristics, elevating maximum temperature increases, durations of heating above 60$^\circ$C, and fine fuel consumption considerably above measurements when fuels only included other savanna plants. Presence of pine needles depressed post-f$\-$ire numbers of oak stems and grass culms, especially in the interior of grass genets, as well as post-f$\-$ire flowering of grasses. The structural equation model indicated strong direct and indirect pathways from pine needles to post-f$\-$ire responses of oaks and grasses. The experimental field tests of hypotheses, bolstered by structural equation modeling, indicate pyrogenic fine fuels modify characteristics of prescribed fires at ground l$\-$evel, negatively affecting dominant ground-l$\-$ayer oaks and grasses. Frequent fires fueled by pyrogenic needles should maintain humid savannas and generate spatial pyrodiversity that affects composition and dynamics of pine savanna ground-$\-$layer vegetation.},

  abstract = {Moorland habitats dominated by the dwarf shrub Calluna vulgaris provide important ecosystem services. Drought is projected to intensify throughout their range, potentially leading to increased fire severity as moisture is a key control on severity. We studied the effect of low fuel moisture content (FMC) on fire severity by using 2 \texttimes{} 2 m rain-out shelters prior to completing 19 experimental fires in two sites in Scotland (UK): a dry heath with thin organic soils and a raised bog with deep, saturated peat, both dominated by Calluna vulgaris. Reduced FMC of the moss and litter (M/L) layer at both sites, and the soil moisture of the dry heath, increased fire-induced consumption of the M/L layer and soil heating at both sites. Increase in fire severity was greater at the dry heath than at the raised bog, e.g. average maximum temperatures at the soil surface increased from 31 $\smwhtcircle$C to 189 $\smwhtcircle$C at the dry heath, but only from 10 $\smwhtcircle$C to 15 $\smwhtcircle$C at the raised bog. Substantial M/L layer consumption was observed when its FMC was below 150\%. This led to larger seasonal and daily soil temperature fluctuation, particularly at the dry heath during warm months. The results suggest that low FMC following predicted changes in climate are likely to increase wildfire severity and that the impact on vegetation composition and carbon stores may be greater at heathlands than at peatlands. Managed burning aiming to minimise fire severity (e.g. ignition of the M/L layer and exposure to lethal temperatures of ericoid seeds) should be carried out when the FMC of the M/L layer is above 150\% and the FMC of the soil is above 200\textendash{}300\%.},

  abstract = {Understanding the relationship between fire intensity and fuel mass is essential information for scientists and forest managers seeking to manage forests using prescribed fires. Peak burning temperature, duration of heating, and area under the temperature profile are fire behavior metrics obtained from thermocoupledatalogger assemblies used to characterize prescribed burns. Despite their recurrent usage in prescribed burn studies, there is no simple protocol established to guide the orientation of thermocouple installation. Our results from dormant and growing season burns in coastal longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) forests in South Carolina suggest that thermocouples located horizontally at the litter-soil interface record significantly higher estimates of peak burning temperature, duration of heating, and area under the temperature profile than thermocouples extending 28 cm vertically above the litter-soil interface (p $<$ 0.01). Surprisingly, vertical and horizontal estimates of these measures did not show strong correlation with one another (r2 \textsterling{} 0.14). The horizontal duration of heating values were greater in growing season burns than in dormant season burns (p $<$ 0.01), but the vertical values did not indicate this difference (p = 0.52). Field measures of fuel mass and depth before and after fire showed promise as significant predictive variables (p \textsterling{} 0.05) for the fire behavior metrics. However, all correlation coefficients were less than or equal to r2 = 0.41. Given these findings, we encourage scientists, researchers, and managers to carefully consider thermocouple orientation when investigating fire behavior metrics, as orientation may affect estimates of fire intensity and the distinction of fire treatment effects, particularly in forests with litter-dominated surface fuels.},

  abstract = {Understanding the drivers of ecosystem responses to disturbance is essential for management aimed at maintaining or restoring ecosystem processes and services, especially where invasive species respond strongly to disturbance. In this study, we used repeat vegetation surveys from a network of prescribed fire treatments at the woodland\textendash{}shrubland interface in the Shoshone Mountains, Nevada, USA, to investigate post-fire responses of the understory plant community. First, we characterized post-fire community trajectories for sites located along an elevational gradient, hypothesizing a positive relationship between elevation and resistance to invasion. Unburned understory communities and their responses to disturbance differed along the gradient. As hypothesized, lower elevations experienced greater species turnover and higher invasive annual grass (Bromus tectorum) cover after fire. Second, we characterized post-fire plant community trajectories for sites with varying levels of pre-fire pinyon and juniper cover, hypothesizing that pre-fire tree dominance and associated reductions in perennial understory species lead to less predictable post-fire trajectories. Among sites with low-to-moderate tree cover, burning largely eliminated differences in understory composition, suggesting that biotic legacies were sufficient to result in predictable trajectories. In contrast, sites with high pre-fire tree cover transitioned into an annual forbdominated community with sparse vegetation cover, suggesting that the loss of the understory community initiated unpredictable and divergent post-fire trajectories. Because plant communities were still changing four years after fire, it is unclear whether the alternate trajectories in sites with high tree cover will result in the formation of alternate states, or whether community composition will eventually converge with other sites at the same elevation. Results indicate that careful evaluation of site characteristics can be used to predict treatment outcomes at the woodland\textendash{}shrubland interface, and to guide the appropriate use of prescribed fire or other management practices.},

Therefore, the abundance of nymphal, larval, and adult /. scapularis was monitored by dragging the vegetation at 2 separate 4-ha tracts in Cockaponset State Forest in Connecticut following a single controlled burn on 15 April or 21 May 1992. The burn at the April burn site was rated as light to moderate with aflameheight of 0.3 m and consumed =367\% of the surface leaf litter. The burn at the May burn site was rated moderate to severe with aflameheight of 0.6-0.9 m., which consumed vegetation $<$5 cm in diameter and ='100\% of the surface leaf litter. The impact of the burn was strongly influenced by the intensity and timing of the burn. Burning of the vegetation resulted in a reduction of the abundance of nymphal I. scapularis by 74\% at the moderately burned site and 97\% at the severely burned site, compared with adjacent unburned woodland. No larvae were recovered later in the summer from the severely burned tract. However, judging by the comparable abundance of adult /. scapularis in the fall at the burned and unburned woodlands, the effect of the burns was temporary. Burning the vegetation for the control of I. scapularis appears limited in effect and could be applied only on a large scale in areas with little or no human habitations.},

Ticks did not differ among burn treatments; however, tick abundance differed between years among total, adult, and larval ticks. Habitat variables showed a weak negative correlation to total ticks in respect to: Shannon diversity index, percent bare ground, perennial cover, and coarse woody debris. Nymphal ticks showed a weak negative correlation to percent bare ground and fewer adults were collected in areas with more leaf litter and coarse woody debris. Conversely, we found larvae more often in areas with more total cover, biennials, vines, shrubs, and leaf litter, suggesting habitat is important for this life stage. We compared weather variables to tick presence and found, in 2015, temperature, precipitation, humidity, and sample period influenced tick collection and were life stage specific. In 2016, temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind, and sample period influenced tick collection and were also life stage specific. These results indicate that spring burns in an oak woodland do not reduce ticks; other variables such as habitat and weather are more influential on tick abundance or presence at different life stages.},

  abstract = {Roads are a widespread and increasing feature of most landscapes. We reviewed the scientific literature on the ecological effects of roads and found support for the general conclusion that they are associated with negative effects on biotic integrity in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Roads of all kinds have seven general effects: mortality from road construction, mortality from collision with vehicles, modification of animal behavior, alteration of the physical environment, alteration of the chemical environment, spread of exotics, and increased use of areas by humans. Road construction kills sessile and slow-moving organisms, injures organisms adjacent to a road, and alters physical conditions beneath a road. Vehicle collisions affect the demography of many species, both vertebrates and invertebrates; mitigation measures to reduce roadkill have been only partly successful. Roads alter animal behavior by causing changes in home ranges, movement, reproductive success, escape response, and physiological state. Roads change soil density, temperature, soil water content, light levels, dust, surface waters, patterns of runoff, and sedimentation, as well as adding heavy metals (especially lead), salts, organic molecules, ozone, and nutrients to roadside environments. Roads promote the dispersal of exotic species by altering habitats, stressing native species, and providing movement corridors. Roads also promote increased hunting, fishing, passive harassment of animals, and landscape modifications. Not all species and ecosystems are equally affected by roads, but overall the presence of roads is highly correlated with changes in species composition, population sizes, and hydrologic and geomorphic processes that shape aquatic and riparian systems. More experimental research is needed to complement post-hoc correlative studies. Our review underscores the importance to conservation of avoiding construction of new roads in roadless or sparsely roaded areas and of removal or restoration of existing roads to benefit both terrestrial and aquatic biota.},

  abstract = {Although forest edges have been studied extensively as an important consequence of fragmentation, a unifying theory of edge influence has yet to be developed. Our objective was to take steps toward the development of such a theory by (1) synthesizing the current knowledge of patterns of forest structure and composition at anthropogenically created forest edges, (2) developing hypotheses about the magnitude and distance of edge influence that consider the ecological processes influencing these patterns, and (3) identifying needs for future research. We compiled data from 44 published studies on edge influence on forest structure and composition in boreal, temperate, and tropical forests. Abiotic and biotic gradients near created forest edges generate a set of primary responses to edge creation. Indirect effects from these primary responses and the original edge gradient perpetuate edge influence, leading to secondary responses. Further changes in vegetation affect the edge environment, resulting in ongoing edge dynamics. We suggest that the magnitude and distance of edge influence are a direct function of the contrast in structure and composition between adjacent communities on either side of the edge. Local factors such as climate, edge characteristics, stand attributes, and biotic factors affect patch contrast. Regional factors define the context within which to assess the ecological significance of edge influence (the degree to which the edge habitat differs from interior forest habitat). Our hypotheses will help predict edge influence on structure and composition in forested ecosystems, an important consideration for conservation. For future research on forest edges in fragmented landscapes, we encourage the testing of our hypotheses, the use of standardized methodology, complete descriptions of study sites, studies on other types of edges, synthesis of edge influence on different components of the ecosystem, and investigations of edges in a landscape context.},

Edge effects were also stronger for forested ecosystems compared with open habitats and for temperate regions. Because the studies here evaluated did not simultaneously evaluate bottom\DH{} up and top\DH{} down factors, the mechanisms responsible for the patterns found cannot be properly addressed, although variation in host plant chemistry, relaxation of pressure exerted by natural enemies, or both, can be suggested as potential factors explaining variation in herbivory between edge and interior habitats.

Growth and survivorship of transplanted seedlings of introduced tree species (Leucaena leucocephala, Muntingia calabura, Adenanthera pavonia, and Clausena excavata) were used to assess abiotic (light regime) and biotic resistance (herbivory) to invasion of rainforest on Christmas Island (Indian Ocean). At four sites, seedlings were transplanted into the forest edge along roadside verges and into adjacent intact forest; half were caged to prevent access by the dominant seedling consumer, the red land crab (Gecarcoidea natalis). Red crab densities did not differ between roadside and forest plots. Red crabs initially reduced survivorship of Leucaena in both edge and interior plots but virtually all seedlings in the forest interior were dead after 41 weeks. Survivorship of Muntingia was also initially reduced by crabs in the forest edge, but again, all but one seedling died by the end of the experiment. Seedlings of Adenanthera and Clausena fared much better overall, surviving well in both locations. Red crabs had no overall effect on Adenanthera survival but significantly reduced survival of Clausena in forest plots. For both species, seedling performance was greater in the forest edge than in the forest interior. Red crabs had no effect on height increment for either species; however, for Clausena, red crabs reduced seedling mass in the forest interior. Both Adenanthera and Clausena were able to persist in the intact forest. Clausena is now actively invading intact rainforest, but Adenanthera appears dispersal-limited. Resistance factors in intact forest appear hierarchical: biotic resistance afforded by land crabs can impede establishment of some plant invaders but seedling responses to abiotic factors (e.g., the light regime) largely overwhelm its effect. Together, these two community attributes are likely to restrict the range of plant invaders to a small suite of species that can successfully establish in intact rainforest on the island. However, increased propagule pressure from a variety of shade-tolerant species and further declines in the abundance of the dominant seedling consumer may lead to increasing invasion success in this island rainforest.},

  title = {Vegetation and {{Microclimatic Edge Effects}} in {{Two Mixed}}-{{Mesophytic Forest Fragments}}},
  abstract = {Forest edges are known to consist of microenvironments that may provide habitat for a different suite of species than forest interiors. Several abiotic attributes of the microenvironment may contribute to this change across the edge to center gradient (e.g., light, air temperature, soil moisture, humidity). Biotic components, such as seed dispersal, may also give rise to changes in species composition from forest edge to interior. We predicted that abiotic and biotic measures would correlate with distance from forest edge and would differ among aspects. To test these predictions, we measured abiotic and biotic variables on twelve 175 m transects in each of two 24 ha forest fragments in east-central Illinois that have remained in continuous isolation for upwards of 100 years. Both univariate and multivariate techniques were used to best describe the complex relationships among abiotic factors and between abiotic and biotic factors. Results indicate that microclimatic variables differ in the degree to and distance over which they show an edge effect. Relative humidity shows the widest edge, while light and soil moisture have the steepest gradients. Aspect influences are evidenced by the existence of more pronounced edge effects on south and west edges, except when these edges are protected by adjacent habitat. Edges bordered by agricultural fields have more extreme changes in microclimate than those bordered by trees. According to PC A results, species richness correlates well with microclimatic variation, especially light and soil moisture; however, in many cases species richness had a different depth of edge influence than either of these variables. The herbaceous plant community is heavily dominated by three species. Distributions of individual species as well as changes in plant community composition, estimated with a similarity index, indicate that competition may be influencing the response of the vegetation to the edge to interior gradient. This study indicates that edge effects must be considered when the size and potential buffering habitat of forest preserves are planned.},

Two recent studies in The Netherlands and Massachusetts (U.S.A.) evaluated several ecological effects of roads, including traffic noise effects, and provide quantitative evidence for a definable ``road-effect zone.'' Based on the approximate width of this asymmetric convoluted zone, I estimate that about one-fifth of the U.S. land area is directly affected ecologically by the system of public roads. I identify a series of assumptions and variables suggesting that over time this preliminary estimate is more likely to rise than drop. Several transportation planning and policy recommendations, ranging from perforating the road barrier for wildlife crossings to closing certain roads, offer promise for reducing this enormous ecological effect.},

  abstract = {Anthropogenic activities can promote plant invasions by changing habitat conditions and the dispersal of invasive plant propagules. Invasions are often more common near roads and in young habitats than in interior and mature habitats, but it is unknown if these patterns are due to differences in habitat conditions or to dispersal limitation. We tested if reduced colonization of interior and mature forests by invasive plants is due to unfavorable habitat conditions. We experimentally introduced seeds and seedlings of three invasive and three native species at six distances from roads in a series of young and mature forests. Seed germination and seedling survival, growth, and herbivore damage were quantified over three years. Exotics had higher germination rates than natives with the greatest difference in mature forests. Both native and exotic seedling growth declined with increasing distance from roads. Overall, seedling growth was much greater in young compared to mature forests. Despite growth rate differences, more than 75\% of exotic and native seedlings survived over the experiment. Native species suffered significantly more herbivory than exotic species, suggesting that their growth may be suppressed by herbivory. In general, conditions along roads and in young forests promoted invasive shrub growth but invasions were not entirely limited by conditions in interior and mature forests. Our results show that two common landscape features, roads, and successional age heterogeneity, can influence the distribution of plant invasions. To better manage these invasive species, mature forests should be maintained and disturbances such as road\textendash{}building should be avoided.},

  abstract = {Invasion by nonnative species is considered one of the greatest threats to ecosystem structure and function worldwide. Human disturbance and landscape fragmentation create edge habitats that are often higher in resource (i.e., light and nutrient) availability and are noted for having a high degree of invasive species establishment and colonization. In contrast, interior forest understories, which are often lightand nutrient-limited, are typically less susceptible to invasion. We assessed invasive species presence in interior, intact, temperate forest understories in relation to canopy-induced environmental conditions. We hypothesized that nonnative invasive species presence would be greatest under those canopy tree species that allow higher understory light and/or soil nitrate levels as a result of inherent differences in canopy transmission, spring leaf phenology, and nitrogen fixation. Five native forest canopy types were used, Populus tremuloides (quaking aspen), Acer saccharum (sugar maple), Quercus spp./Carya spp. (oak/ hickory), Fraxinus americana (white ash), evergreen species mix Pinus spp./Tsuga canadensis (pine/hemlock), along with one nonnative canopy species, Robinia pseudoacacia (black locust). Measures of understory light availability post leaf-expansion were significantly higher under quaking aspen than other canopies with the exception of black locust and white ash. Canopy bud break and leaf flush occurred first in quaking aspen stands followed by sugar maple, oak/hickory, white ash and black locust stands, respectively. As expected, soil analyses showed higher nitrate levels in the nitrogen-fixing black locust stands, but unexpectedly, also in the white ash stands. Under these two canopy types, invasive species cover and relative abundance were significantly higher suggesting the importance of greater resource availability in invasive plant success. As such, intact forest stands with greater light transmission, later phenology, and nitrate fixation act as islands of invasion in resource-limited forested landscapes.},

  abstract = {The estimation of the road edge effect is useful to understand changes induced by the road network on ecosystems. Road networks on islands may break ecosystem integrity through microclimate edge effects, which are known to be associated with disturbances to animal and plant communities. Road edge effects have been scarcely studied on oceanic islands. In this paper we studied road edge effects on microclimate and canopy structure in laurel and pine forests in Tenerife (Canary Islands). We assessed depth of road edge effect for temperature at four vertical layers (soil, litter and air at 5 cm and 1.3 m above ground), light intensity, canopy cover and height, in transects running from narrow (6\textendash{}7 m width) asphalt roads and dust trails to 100 m to the interior of both forests. We used an ANOVA procedure with Helmert difference contrasts to identify the distances along transects over which edge effects were significant. We detected significant gradients for most parameters but they were consistently narrow both within and between forests. In the laurel forest, we detected highly significant gradients for soil temperature, light, and canopy cover and height in both asphalt and unpaved roads. In the pine forest, we detected a highly significant gradient for soil temperature at asphalt roads, and a significant light gradient for both asphalt and unpaved roads. From the road edge to the forest interior, significant temperature changes persisted for only 3 m, light variation persisted for 6 m, and canopy cover and height changed significantly within the first 10 m. Asphalt roads and dust trails revealed different patterns of variation for temperature between edge and interior. No differences were found between the two types of roads in edge-interior trends for light or canopy structure. The abruptness of microclimate and canopy gradients was slightly higher in the laurel forest than in the pine forest, caused by a higher edge contrast in the former. The depth of the road edge effect found in laurel and pine forests was small, but it could have cumulative effects on forest microclimate and forest associated biota at the island scale. Such changes deserve attention by local road managers for planning and design purposes.},

  abstract = {A key goal of conservation biology is to prevent the spread of exotic species. Previous work on exotic invasion has two limitations: (1) the lack of a spatially explicit approach and (2) a primary focus on the net effect of invasion by examining invasive species already present in the community. We address these limitations by focusing on the arrival of a potential invader into a community and use a spatially explicit approach to quantify the flow of seeds from the surrounding landscape into the interior of a forest. We hypothesize that the structure of forest-edge vegetation influences how the edge mediates seed flux. To test our hypothesis, we experimentally altered vegetation structure within 20 m of the edge to create two edge treatments: thinned and intact. We quantified the flux of seeds moving into the forest interior across the two treatments. We used seed traps randomly arrayed on transects from 5 to 50 m into the forest. More seeds crossed the thinned treatment than crossed the intact treatment to reach the forest interior. In addition, seeds that crossed the thinned treatment dispersed farther into the forest than those that crossed the intact treatment.},

  abstract = {We assessed alien plant invasion of old-growth forest islands in rural central Indiana by means of paired sample sites along "warm" (south and west) edges and "cool" (north and east) edges in each of seven forest remnants. In general, the fragments appeared resistant to alien invasion; alien species richness and frequency dropped sharply inward from forest edges, and forest interiors were relatively free of aliens. However, aliens were more diverse and more frequent on warm edges than on cool ones. The main factor limiting invasion is probably low light availability in forest interiors, though limited dispersal and low disturbance levels may also be important We suggest that invasion is discouraged by the edge response of the forests themselves: development of a dense wall of bordering vegetation that reduces interior light levels and wind speeds. The most successful invaders are mostly escaped ornamentals or other species not commonly found in adjoining fields. They can be expected to become more prominent in the future, but their spread at the landscape scale may be slowed by the "oceans" of cropland surrounding these forest islands.},

We studied the effect of forest road distance on plant understory diversity at 20 sites in young and adult oak stands in a French lowland forest with a long history of management and road construction. All vascular and bryophyte species were collected at five distances ranging from the road verge to 100 m into the adjacent forest stand. We analysed species composition, individual species response, a priori life-history traits response \textendash{} life form, habitat preference and dispersal mode \textendash{} and environmental indicator values in relation to road distance and stand age. Plant composition strongly differed between road verge and forest interior habitats. The main road effect extended less than 5 m into the forest stand. A third habitat was detected at the forest-road edge resulting from the road effect on light and soil conditions, and from edge-specific topography. Non-forest species were almost absent from the forest interior. In contrast, many bryophytes and several vascular plants kept away from the road. We identified a posteriori six species groups that better explained the variability of plant response profiles than a priori life-history traits. Plant response to road distance was also dependent on stand age: some species colonised from the road into the forest interior in young stands following regeneration cutting, while other species displayed the reverse pattern in adult stands once canopy closed above the forest road. Even if the depth of forest road effect measured in lowland managed stands was narrow, building of a new forest road has nonnegligible effects on plant population dynamics. Forest managers should take into account the impacts of roads on biodiversity, since the expected intensification of silviculture in response to global changes is set to accentuate the effect of forest roads. We recommend further study on the role of dispersal by vehicles (i.e. agestochory) in road effects.},

  abstract = {One explanation for the success of exotic plants in their introduced habitats is that, upon arriving to a new continent, plants escaped their native herbivores or pathogens, resulting in less damage and lower abundance of enemies than closely related native species (enemy release hypothesis). We tested whether the three exotic plant species, Rubus phoenicolasius (wineberry), Fallopia japonica (Japanese knotweed), and Persicaria perfoliata (mile-a-minute weed), suffered less herbivory or pathogen attack than native species by comparing leaf damage and invertebrate herbivore abundance and diversity on the invasive species and their native congeners. Fallopia japonica and R. phoenicolasius received less leaf damage than their native congeners, and F. japonica also contained a lower diversity and abundance of invertebrate herbivores. If the observed decrease in damage experienced by these two plant species contributes to increased fitness, then escape from enemies may provide at least a partial explanation for their invasiveness. However, P. perfoliata actually received greater leaf damage than its native congener. Rhinoncomimus latipes, a weevil previously introduced in the United States as a biological control for P. perfoliata, accounted for the greatest abundance of insects collected from P. perfoliata. Therefore, it is likely that the biocontrol R. latipes was responsible for the greater damage on P. perfoliata, suggesting this insect may be effective at controlling P. perfoliata populations if its growth and reproduction is affected by the increased herbivore damage.},

  abstract = {Prescribed fire temporarily can alter food and cover resources for ground-dwelling wildlife, potentially leading to changes in animal abundance. Small mammals are an important ecosystem component in many terrestrial communities and depend on ground-level vegetation most commonly affected by prescribed fire. In this complex system of food and cover availability where easier access to food might compromise cover, and vice versa, it is imperative to study postfire habitat use by mice and other grounddwelling wildlife. We evaluated effects of time since burn and vegetation type on Peromyscus spp. abundance in a longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystem in Fort Bragg Military Installation, North Carolina, USA, during 2011 and 2012. We trapped in 5 vegetation types and captured 208 individual Peromyscus. Peromyscus abundance did not differ among 1, 2, and 3 years postburn upland pine vegetation types, although we noted a trend of decreasing abundance as time since burn increased; however, abundance was greater in the lowland hardwood vegetation type than in open areas (i.e., military drop zones). The lack of an effect of time since burn could be due to the short fire-return interval at the study site, which limited the time for postburn shifts in the composition of the understory from herbaceous to woody plant species. Therefore, we suggest future research in the longleaf pine ecosystem incorporate a wider time frame to assess short- and long-term effects of fire on small mammal populations. \'O 2017 The Wildlife Society.},

Concurrently, other human-biting tick species were investigated as potential B. burgdorferi vectors. Rashes thought to be erythema migrans were observed in patients bitten by Amblyomma americanum (L.) (Acari: Ixodidae) ticks, and spirochetes were visualized in a small percentage of A. americanum using fluorescent antibody staining methods, sparking interest in this species as a candidate vector of B. burgdorferi. Using molecular methods, the spirochetes were subsequently described as Borrelia lonestari sp. nov. (Spirocheatales: Spirochaetaceae), a transovarially transmitted relapsing fever Borrelia of uncertain clinical significance. In total, 54 surveys from more than 35 research groups, involving more than 52,000 ticks, have revealed a low prevalence of B. lonestari, and scarce B. burgdorferi, in A. americanum. In Lyme disease-endemic areas, A. americanum commonly feeds on B. burgdorferi-infected hosts; the extremely low prevalence of B. burgdorferi in this tick results from a saliva barrier to acquiring infection from infected hosts. At least nine transmission experiments involving B. burgdorferi in A. americanum have failed to demonstrate vector competency. Advancements in molecular analysis strongly suggest that initial reports of B. burgdorferi in A. americanum across many states were misidentified B. lonestari, or DNA contamination, yet the early reports continue to be cited without regard to the later clarifying studies. In this article, the surveillance and vector competency studies of B. burgdorferi in A. americanum are reviewed, and we conclude that A. americanum is not a vector of B. burgdorferi.},

The framework focuses on flows of organisms, materials, energy, or information in heterogenous mosaics; it specifies patch contrast, identity of the flow, and nature of the boundary as the concepts to quantify in any model. The model template arranges these components in a functional form to elucidate specific boundary relationships. From the model template, working models that are system and scale specific can be developed.

Roadways are increasingly abundant, human-made features that can be conduits for the spread of invasive exotic plants in a number of ecosystems. Little is known, however, about the role of roads in eastern deciduous forest ecosystems where road density is high. Further, it is not known whether the distribution of exotic plants along roads depends on the successional age of the forest. In this study, densities of four of seven exotic shrub species declined with increasing distance to the nearest road across all successional ages. Greater densities of exotic shrubs were found in young and mid-successional forests than mature forests. However, there was no interaction between distance to road and forest age, suggesting that the role of roads in the invasion process does not change across forest successional ages. We outline several potential mechanisms that may drive patterns of shrub distribution along roadside edges as a guide for future research.},

This contrasts with our general understanding of invasive species physiology derived primarily from studies in high-resource environments. These studies suggest that invasive species succeed through high resource acquisition. This review examines physiological and morphological traits of native and invasive species in low-resource environments. Existing data support the idea that species invading low-resource environments possess traits associated with resource acquisition, resource conservation or both. Disturbance and climate change are affecting resource availability in many ecosystems, and understanding physiological differences between native and invasive species may suggest ways to restore invaded ecosystems.},

We explored the relative importance of factors driving invasions using detailed data on the distribution and percentage cover of alien tree species on South Africa's Agulhas Plain (2,160 km2). Classification trees based on geology, climate, land use, and topography adequately explained distribution but not abundance (canopy cover) of three widespread invasive species (Acacia cyclops, Acacia saligna, and Pinus pinaster). A semimechanistic model was then developed to quantify the roles of propagule pressure and environmental heterogeneity in structuring invasion patterns. The intensity of propagule pressure (approximated by the distance from putative invasion foci) was a much better predictor of canopy cover than any environmental factor that was considered. The influence of environmental factors was then assessed on the residuals of the first model to determine how propagule pressure interacts with environmental factors. The mediating effect of environmental factors was species specific. Models combining propagule pressure and environmental factors successfully predicted more than 70\% of the variation in canopy cover for each species.},

We evaluated the influence of seasonal prescribed fire and overstory density on vegetation structure across overstory, midstory, and understory vegetation strata of a 23-year-old longleaf pine plantation in west-central Georgia. After three prescribed fire cycles through 8 years, we found significantly fewer broad-leaved woody stems in the midstory on both winter- and summer-burned plots compared to unburned plots, as well as fourfold greater herbaceous vegetation cover on burned plots compared to unburned plots. While we predicted that summer burning may be more important in controlling woody plants on low-density overstory plots compared to high-density plots, we found no meaningful interactions between fire seasonality and overstory density. Reductions in litter cover via prescribed fire appeared to be an important mechanism regulating herbaceous vegetation, suggesting that restoration should emphasize management of the forest floor to reduce litter cover and enhance opportunities for herbaceous plant establishment.},

  abstract = {Recent and projected increases in the frequency and severity of large wildfires in the western U.S. makes understanding the factors that strongly affect landscape fire patterns a management priority for optimizing treatment location. We compared the influence of variations in the local environment on burn severity patterns on the large 2013 Rim fire that burned under extreme drought with those of previous smaller fires for a study area in the Sierra Nevada, California, USA. Although much of the Rim fire burned during plume-dominated conditions resulting in large high-severity patches, our study area burned under milder fire weather resulting in a mix of fire severities. In our study area the Rim fire produced a higher proportion of moderate- and high-severity effects than occurred in previous fires. Random forest modeling explained up to 63\% of the Rim fire burn variance using seven predictors: time since previous fire, actual evapotranspiration (AET), climatic water deficit (Deficit), previous maximum burn severity, burning index, slope position, and solar radiation. Models using only a subset of biophysical predictors (AET, Deficit, slope position and steepness, and solar radiation) explained 55\% of the Rim fire and 58\% of the maximum fire burn severity of previous fires. The relationship of burn severity to patterns of AET, however, reversed for the Rim fire (positive) compared to earlier fires (negative). Measurements of pre-Rim fire forest structure from LiDAR did not improve our ability to explain burn severity patterns. We found that accounting for spatial autocorrelation in burn severity and biophysical environment was important to model quality and stability. Our results suggest water balance and topography can help predict likely burn severity patterns under moderate climate and fire weather conditions, providing managers with general guidance for prioritizing fuel treatments and identifying where fire is less likely to burn with higher severities even for locations with higher forest density and canopy cover.},

Recently, Land Surface Temperature (LST) calculated from remote sensing data has been considered as a potential indicator for estimating burn severity. However, using the LST-based index alone may not be sufficient for estimating burn severity in the areas that has unburned trees and vegetation. In this paper, a new index is proposed by considering LST and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) together. The accuracy of the proposed index was evaluated by using 264 composite burn index (CBI) field sample data of the five fires across different regional eco-type areas in the Western United States. Results show that the proposed index performed equally well for post-fire areas covered with both sparse vegetation and dense vegetation and relatively better than some commonly-used burn severity indices. This index also has high potential of estimating burn severity if more accurate surface temperatures can be obtained in the future.},

  abstract = {Fire is an important disturbance worldwide, and literature supports the use of prescribed fire to restore and maintain fire-dependent ecosystems. However, fire could alter the abundance and persistence of some arthropods, in turn influencing vertebrate taxa that depend on those arthropods as a food source. We used replicated prescribed fire treatments to evaluate macroarthropod response to time-since-fire in the fire-maintained longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystem. We sampled macroarthropod assemblages using vinyl gutter pitfall traps for 5 consecutive days in each month of the study (May-August 2014) in each replicate burn block. We identified macroarthropods to Order and dried and weighed the samples to determine biomass (g) of all taxa detected. We focused our analyses on 4 macroarthropod taxa important as food for wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo): Araneae, Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, and Orthoptera. We used standard least squares regression to evaluate the effect of time-since-fire on total biomass of the 4 Orders (and we also evaluated those Orders independently). The analysis indicated that time-sincefire had no effect (p = 0.2616) on combined biomass of these 4 taxa. Analyzing the 4 Orders separately, biomass of Araneae (p = 0.0057) and Orthoptera (p = 0.0004) showed significant effects of time-sincefire, while Coleoptera (p = 0.9465) and Hymenoptera (p = 0.1175) did not. Parameter estimates (Araneae = 0.0084; SE = 0.0029; Orthoptera = 0.0137; SE = 0.0036) indicated that greater time-since-fire resulted in greater biomass for those 2 Orders. Overall, time-since-fire did not appear to have substantial effects on macroarthropod biomass. However, responses by Araneae and Orthoptera provided evidence that longer time-since-fire may result in greatest levels of biomass for some taxa. Our results indicate the use of frequent prescribed fire to restore and maintain longleaf forests is unlikely to pose risks to overall macroarthropod biomass, particularly if heterogeneity in fire frequency and spatial extent occurs on the landscape.},

We investigated the effects of prescribed fire, fire history, dispersal, and abiotic conditions on the invasibility of sites along the gradient. Across 18 study sites, seeds of the six woody species were sown using three sowing methods that mimicked primary and secondary dispersal; each site contained paired plots located in savanna and savanna-wetland ecotone vegetation communities. We identified sowing treatment, abiotic conditions, seedling size, and prescribed fire as important factors for controlling woody invasion, as they prevented 5 of 6 study species from establishing in the landscape. However, the landscape was not immune to invasion. At the end of the 42-month study period, three species had established in unburned sites. In sites burned after seedling emergence, only one species, Pyrus calleryana, survived and established. We found P. calleryana survival and establishment to be a function of seedling size, soil humic matter content, and sowing treatment. Successful invasion and establishment of woody individuals in open-canopied systems increases the likelihood of fire-deterrence and further woody encroachment, threatening ecosystem integrity.},

  abstract = {Null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) is the dominant statistical approach in biology, although it has many, frequently unappreciated, problems. Most importantly, NHST does not provide us with two crucial pieces of information: (1) the magnitude of an effect of interest, and (2) the precision of the estimate of the magnitude of that effect. All biologists should be ultimately interested in biological importance, which may be assessed using the magnitude of an effect, but not its statistical significance. Therefore, we advocate presentation of measures of the magnitude of effects (i.e. effect size statistics) and their confidence intervals (CIs) in all biological journals. Combined use of an effect size and its CIs enables one to assess the relationships within data more effectively than the use of p values, regardless of statistical significance. In addition, routine presentation of effect sizes will encourage researchers to view their results in the context of previous research and facilitate the incorporation of results into future meta-analysis, which has been increasingly used as the standard method of quantitative review in biology. In this article, we extensively discuss two dimensionless (and thus standardised) classes of effect size statistics: d statistics (standardised mean difference) and r statistics (correlation coefficient), because these can be calculated from almost all study designs and also because their calculations are essential for meta-analysis. However, our focus on these standardised effect size statistics does not mean unstandardised effect size statistics (e.g. mean difference and regression coefficient) are less important. We provide potential solutions for four main technical problems researchers may encounter when calculating effect size and CIs: (1) when covariates exist, (2) when bias in estimating effect size is possible, (3) when data have non-normal error structure and/or variances, and (4) when data are non-independent. Although interpretations of effect sizes are often difficult, we provide some pointers to help researchers. This paper serves both as a beginner's instruction manual and a stimulus for changing statistical practice for the better in the biological sciences.},

  abstract = {Aim It is usually thought that habitat fragmentation acts negatively on species survival, and consequently, on biodiversity. Recent literature challenges whether habitat fragmentation per se affects species richness, beyond the effect of habitat area. Theoretical studies have suggested that fragmentation may matter most when the amount of available habitat is small or at intermediate levels. However, a recent review suggests that the effect of fragmentation on species richness is usually positive. Here, we dissect the richness\textendash{}fragmentation relationship. What is the effect size? Does it depend upon the amount of habitat cover? How do individual species respond to fragmentation? Methods Applying a macroecological approach, we empirically related avian richness and the probability of occurrence (pocc) of individual species to fragmentation (number of patches), after controlling for habitat amount in 991 landscapes, each 100-km2, in southern Ontario, Canada. Results Species richness was strongly related to total habitat amount, but habitat fragmentation had no detectable additional effect. Individual species' pocc related strongly to habitat amount. For some species, pocc also related secondarily to habitat fragmentation within landscapes. Logistic models revealed that pocc related significantly negatively to fragmentation after controlling for habitat amount for only 13\% of forest- and 18\% of open-habitat species bird species. However, pocc related significantly positively to fragmentation for even greater proportions of species, including some red-listed species. Fragmentation effects were not stronger at low or intermediate levels of habitat amount within landscapes. Conclusion In earlier studies, negative effects of isolation were observed at the patch level in experimental manipulations. However, at the landscape level, avian species richness in southern Ontario apparently responds primarily to habitat amount and negligibly to fragmentation. We argue that the evidence is inconsistent with the hypothesis that reducing habitat fragmentation per se would be an effective conservation strategy for birds at the landscape level.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.ttbdis.2018.04.016},
  abstract = {An increasing number of studies have investigated the consequences of biodiversity loss for the occurrence of vector-borne diseases such as Lyme borreliosis, the most common tick-borne disease in the northern hemisphere. As host species differ in their ability to transmit the Lyme borreliosis bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. to ticks, increased host diversity can decrease disease prevalence by increasing the proportion of dilution hosts, host species that transmit pathogens less efficiently. Previous research shows that Lyme borreliosis risk differs between forest types and suggests that a higher diversity of host species might dilute the contribution of small rodents to infect ticks with B. afzelii, a common Borrelia genospecies. However, empirical evidence for a dilution effect in Europe is largely lacking. We tested the dilution effect hypothesis in 19 Belgian forest stands of different forest types along a diversity gradient. We used empirical data and a Bayesian belief network to investigate the impact of the proportion of dilution hosts on the density of ticks infected with B. afzelii, and identified the key drivers determining the density of infected ticks, which is a measure of human infection risk. Densities of ticks and B. afzelii infection prevalence differed between forest types, but the model indicated that the density of infected ticks is hardly affected by dilution. The most important variables explaining variability in disease risk were related to the density of ticks. Combining empirical data with a model-based approach supported decision making to reduce tick-borne disease risk. We found a low probability of a dilution effect for Lyme borreliosis in a north-western European context. We emphasize that under these circumstances, Lyme borreliosis prevention should rather aim at reducing tick-human contact rate instead of attempting to increase the proportion of dilution hosts.},

  abstract = {Patterns of vector-borne disease risk are changing globally in space and time and elevated disease risk of vector-borne infection can be driven by anthropogenic modification of the environment. Incidence of Lyme disease, caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, has risen in a number of locations in North America and this increase may be driven by spatially or numerically expanding populations of the primary tick vector, Ixodes scapularis. We used a model selection approach to identify habitat fragmentation and land-use/land cover variables to test the hypothesis that the amount and configuration of forest cover at spatial scales relevant to deer, the primary hosts of adult ticks, would be the predominant determinants of tick abundance. We expected that land cover heterogeneity and amount of forest edge, a habitat thought to facilitate deer foraging and survival, would be the strongest driver of tick density and that larger spatial scales (5\textendash{}10 km) would be more important than smaller scales (1 km). We generated metrics of deciduous and mixed forest fragmentation using Fragstats 4.4 implemented in ArcMap 10.3 and found, after adjusting for multicollinearity, that total forest edge within a 5 km buffer had a significant negative effect on tick density and that the proportion of forested land cover within a 10 km buffer was positively associated with density of I. scapularis nymphs. None of the 1 km fragmentation metrics were found to significantly improve the fit of the model. Elevation, previously associated with increased density of I. scapularis nymphs in Virginia, while significantly predictive in univariate analysis, was not an important driver of nymph density relative to fragmentation metrics. Our results suggest that amount of forest cover (i.e., lack of fragmentation) is the most important driver of I. scapularis density in our study system.},

To identify areas of suitable habitat, we assembled records of locations throughout California where two or more I. pacificus were collected from vegetation from 1980 to 2014. We then employed ensemble species distribution modeling to identify suitable climatic conditions for the tick and restricted the results to land cover classes where these ticks are typically encountered (i.e., forest, grass, scrub-shrub, riparian). Cold-season temperature and rainfall are particularly important abiotic drivers of suitability, explaining between 50 and 99\% of the spatial variability across California among models. The likelihood of an area being classified as suitable increases steadily with increasing temperatures \&gt;0$^\circ$C during the coldest quarter of the year, and further increases when precipitation amounts range from 400 to 800 mm during the coldest quarter, indicating that areas in California with relatively warm and wet winters typically are most suitable for I. pacificus. Other consistent predictors of suitability include increasing autumn humidity, temperatures in the warmest month between 23 and 33$^\circ$C, and low-temperature variability throughout the year. The resultant climatic suitability maps indicate that coastal California, especially the northern coast, and the western Sierra Nevada foothills have the highest probability of I. pacificus presence.},

  abstract = {Prescribed fire is widely accepted as a conservation tool because fire is essential to the maintenance of native biodiversity in many terrestrial communities. Approaches to this land-management technique vary greatly among continents, and sharing knowledge internationally can inform application of prescribed fire worldwide. In North America, decisions about how and when to apply prescribed fire are typically based on the historical-fire-regime concept (HFRC), which holds that replicating the pattern of fires ignited by lightning or preindustrial humans best promotes native species in fire-prone regions. The HFRC rests on 3 assumptions: it is possible to infer historical fire regimes accurately; fire-suppressed communities are ecologically degraded; and reinstating historical fire regimes is the best course of action despite the global shift toward novel abiotic and biotic conditions. We examined the underpinnings of these assumptions by conducting a literature review on the use of historical fire regimes to inform the application of prescribed fire. We found that the practice of inferring historical fire regimes for entire regions or ecosystems often entails substantial uncertainty and can yield equivocal results; ecological outcomes of fire suppression are complex and may not equate to degradation, depending on the ecosystem and context; and habitat fragmentation, invasive species, and other modern factors can interact with fire to produce novel and in some cases negative ecological outcomes. It is therefore unlikely that all 3 assumptions will be fully upheld for any landscape in which prescribed fire is being applied. Although the HFRC is a valuable starting point, it should not be viewed as the sole basis for developing prescribed fire programs. Rather, fire prescriptions should also account for other specific, measurable ecological parameters on a case-by-case basis. To best achieve conservation goals, researchers should seek to understand contemporary fire\textendash{}biota interactions across trophic levels, functional groups, spatial and temporal scales, and management contexts.},

For example, two resources which are nutritionally perfectly substitutable may be operationally switching, antagonistic, or complementary because of spatial heterogeneity. A graphical, equilibrium theory of resource competition allows prediction of the outcome of interactions between several consumers for the various classes of resources. The technique requires information on (1) resource type (growth isoclines), (2) resource preference, (3) resource supply processes, and (4) mortality rates for all species. For all resource types, the major criterion for stable coexistence is that each species consume relatively more of the one resource which more limits its own growth rate.},

Here we show that self-organized clusters of look-a-likes may emerge spontaneously from coevolution of competitors. The explanation is that there are two alternative ways to survive together: being sufficiently different or being sufficiently similar. Using a model based on classical competition theory, we demonstrate a tendency for evolutionary emergence of regularly spaced lumps of similar species along a niche axis. Indeed, such lumpy patterns are commonly observed in size distributions of organisms ranging from algae, zooplankton, and beetles to birds and mammals, and could not be well explained by earlier theory. Our results suggest that these patterns may represent self-constructed niches emerging from competitive interactions. A corollary of our findings is that, whereas in species-poor communities sympatric speciation and invasion of open niches is possible, species-saturated communities may be characterized by convergent evolution and invasion by look-a-likes.},

  abstract = {The effect of life-history traits on resource competition outcomes is well understood in the context of a constant resource supply. However, almost all natural systems are subject to fluctuations of resources driven by cyclical processes such as seasonality and tidal hydrology. To understand community composition, it is therefore imperative to study the impact of resource fluctuations on interspecies competition. We adapted a well-established resource-competition model to show that fluctuations in inflow concentrations of two limiting resources lead to the survival of species in clumps along the trait axis, consistent with observations of ``lumpy coexistence'' [Scheffer M, van Nes EH (2006) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 103:6230\textendash{}6235]. A complex dynamic pattern in the available ambient resources arose very early in the self-organization process and dictated the locations of clumps along the trait axis by creating niches that promoted the growth of species with specific traits. This dynamic pattern emerged as the combined result of fluctuations in the inflow of resources and their consumption by the most competitive species that accumulated the bulk of biomass early in assemblage organization. Clumps emerged robustly across a range of periodicities, phase differences, and amplitudes. Given the ubiquity in the real world of asynchronous fluctuations of limiting resources, our findings imply that assemblage organization in clumps should be a common feature in nature.},

Here we synthesize published research attempting to detect patterns of herbivore densities and herbivory at forest edges, identify the underlying mechanisms generating these patterns, and explore their potential impacts for the forest edge as an ecosystem. Key conclusions are that herbivores, especially generalists, profoundly benefit from forest edges, often due to favourable microenvironmental conditions, an edge-induced increase in food quantity/quality, and (less well documented) disrupted top-down regulation of herbivores. Finally, we present evidence and causal explanations that edge-associated herbivores, via a range of direct and indirect impacts, may alter species interactions, delay successional processes at the edge, and amplify the often human-induced changes on forest biota.},

Rapid spread and interrupted distribution patterns of introduced plant species indicate long-distance dispersal along roads. The extent to which this process is due to species' migration along linear habitats or, alternatively, to seed transport by vehicles has not yet been tested systematically. We tested this by sampling seeds inside long motorway tunnels to exclude nontraffic dispersal. Vehicles transported large amounts of seeds. The annual seed rain caused by vehicles on the roadsides of five different tunnel lanes within three tunnels along a single urban motorway in Berlin, Germany, ranged from 635 to 1579 seeds/m2/year. Seeds of non-native species accounted for 50.0\% of the 204 species and 54.4\% of the total 11,818 seeds trapped inside the tunnels. Among the samples were 39 (19.1\%) highly invasive species that exhibit detrimental effects on native biodiversity in some parts of the world. By comparing the flora in the tunnel with that adjacent to the tunnel entrances we confirmed long-distance dispersal events ($>$250 m) for 32.3\% of the sampled species. Seed sources in a radius of 100 m around the entrances of the tunnels had no significant effect on species richness and species composition of seed samples from inside the tunnels, indicating a strong effect of long-distance dispersal by vehicles. Consistently, the species composition of the tunnel seeds was more similar to the regional roadside flora of Berlin than to the local flora around the tunnel entrances. Long-distance dispersal occurred significantly more frequently in seeds of non-native (mean share 38.5\%) than native species (mean share 4.1\%). Our results showed that long-distance dispersal by vehicles was a routine rather than an occasional mechanism. Dispersal of plants by vehicles will thus accelerate plant invasions and induce rapid changes in biodiversity patterns.},

We tested whether invasiveness is associated with performance related traits (physiology, leaf area allocation, shoot allocation, growth rate, size and fitness), and whether such associations depend on type of study and on biogeographical or biological factors. Overall, invasive species had significantly higher values than non invasive species for all six trait categories. More trait differences were significant for invasive vs. native comparisons than for invasive vs. non invasive alien comparisons. Moreover, for comparisons between invasive species and native species that themselves are invasive elsewhere, no trait differences were significant. Differences in physiology and growth rate were larger in tropical regions than in temperate regions. Trait differences did not depend on whether the invasive alien species originates from Europe, nor did they depend on the test environment. We conclude that invasive alien species had higher values for those traits related to performance than non invasive species.

We found that Centaurea from North America were larger than plants from European populations. North American Centaurea also demonstrated stronger competitive effects and responses than European Centaurea. However, competitive superiority did not come at a cost to herbivore defense. North American plants were much better defended against generalist insect herbivores and slightly better defended against specialists. North Americans showed a stronger inhibitory effect on the consumers (resistance) and a better ability to regrow after attack by herbivores (tolerance). Better defense by North Americans corresponded with higher constitutive levels of a biochemical defense compound precursor, tougher leaves, and more leaf trichomes than Europeans. North American F? progeny of field collected lines retained the traits of larger size and greater leaf toughness suggesting that genetic differences, rather than maternal effects, may be the cause of intercontinental differences, but these sample sizes were small. Our results suggest that the evolution of increased competitive ability may not always be driven by physiological trade-offs between the allocation of energy or resources to growth or to defense. Instead, we hypothesize that Centaurea maculosa experiences strong directional selection on novel competitive and defense traits in its new range.

  abstract = {Human activities, from resource extraction to recreation, are increasing global connectivity, especially to less-disturbed and previously inaccessible places. Such activities necessitate road networks and vehicles. Vehicles can transport reproductive plant propagules long distances, thereby increasing the risk of invasive plant species transport and dispersal. Subsequent invasions by less desirable species have significant implications for the future of threatened species and habitats. The goal of this study was to understand vehicle seed accrual by different vehicle types and under different driving conditions, and to evaluate different mitigation strategies. Using studies and experiments at four sites in the western USA we addressed three questions: How many seeds and species accumulate and are transported on vehicles? Does this differ with vehicle type, driving surface, surface conditions, and season? What is our ability to mitigate seed dispersal risk by cleaning vehicles? Our results demonstrated that vehicles accrue plant propagules, and driving surface, surface conditions, and season affect the rate of accrual: on- and off-trail summer seed accrual on all-terrain vehicles was 13 and 3508 seeds km\`A1, respectively, and was higher in the fall than in the summer. Early season seed accrual on 4-wheel drive vehicles averaged 7 and 36 seeds km\`A1 on paved and unpaved roads respectively, under dry conditions. Furthermore, seed accrual on unpaved roads differed by vehicle type, with tracked vehicles accruing more than small and large 4-wheel drives; and small 4-wheel drives more than large. Rates were dramatically increased under wet surface conditions. Vehicles indiscriminately accrue a wide diversity of seeds (different life histories, forms and seed lengths); total richness, richness of annuals, biennials, forbs and shrubs, and seed length didn't differ among vehicle types, or additional seed bank samples. Our evaluation of portable vehicle wash units showed that approximately 80\% of soil and seed was removed from dirty vehicles. This suggests that interception programs to reduce vehicular seed transportation risk are feasible and should be developed for areas of high conservation value, or where the spread of invasive species is of special concern.},

Plants of both species were sampled along the woodland edges of cedar glades and in the (primarily) redcedar forest at Stones River National Battlefield, Rutherford County, Tennessee, between March 2000 and February 2001. MANOVAs (P $\leq$ 0.05) indicated significant differences between species and habitats for several of the 23 traits measured in the study. Regardless of the habitat, L. sinense had a more treelike growth form\textemdash{}higher leaf area ratio (leafiness), leaf mass ratio (investment in leaf biomass), stem elongation rate, and number of fruits per ramet\textemdash{}and a lower percentage of insect-damaged leaves and leaf abscission rate than F. ligustrina. Height and leaf areas of L. sinense plants growing in the woods were greater than those of L. sinense plants growing along the glade and greater than those of F. ligustrina plants growing in both habitats. Branch architecture did not differ appreciably between the species. Ligustrum sinense appears to possess a competitive advantage over F. ligustrina because of its greater ability to spatially and temporally capture light, a phenomenon that may lead to higher photosynthetic capacity and resource-use efficiency, and because of the higher fruit production we observed.},

Previous work on exotic invasion has two limitations: (1) the lack of a spatially explicit approach and (2) a primary focus on the net effect of invasion by examining invasive species already present in the community. We address these limitations by focusing on the arrival of a potential invader into a community and use a spatially explicit approach to quantify the flow of seeds from the surrounding landscape into the interior of a forest. We hypothesize that the structure of forest-edge vegetation influences how the edge mediates seed flux. To test our hypothesis, we experimentally altered vegetation structure within 20 m of the edge to create two edge treatments: thinned and intact. We quantified the flux of seeds moving into the forest interior across the two treatments. We used seed traps randomly arrayed on transects from 5 to 50 m into the forest. More seeds crossed the thinned treatment than crossed the intact treatment to reach the forest interior. In addition, seeds that crossed the thinned treatment dispersed farther into the forest than those that crossed the intact treatment.},

To determine how edge zone width varies among stands, microenvironmental gradients were described at ten edge sites in southeastern Pennsylvania and northern Delaware, USA. Sites were selected to allow comparisons of edge orientation and successional development. Significant edge effects were detected in light, temperature, litter moisture, vapor pressure deficit, humidity, and shrub cover, in some cases affecting the forest microenvironment up to 50 m from the edge. Variables which were dependent on direct beam radiation (vapor pressure deficit, temperature, and litter moisture) showed strong edge-oriented gradients at edges facing east, west, and south, but none at north-facing sites. Exclusion of light by closure of the side canopy curtailed edge effects in these variables. By contrast, edge-oriented gradients of shrub cover and humidity occurred independently of edge aspect and beyond the limits of direct beam radiation. Edge zone microenvironment remained distinguishable from that of continuous forest even after closure of the side canopy. These findings suggest that a large proportion of forest in small- and medium-sized fragments is climatically altered by edge proximity. Such effects recede over successional time, but are not entirely eliminated.},

One commonly accepted mechanism for exotic plant invasions is the enemy release hypothesis (ERH), which states that plant species, on introduction to an exotic region, experience a decrease in regulation by herbivores and other natural enemies, resulting in a rapid increase in distribution and abundance. The success of classical biological control has been used as support for ERH, but this observational evidence does not directly test ERH, and the more experimental evidence is equivocal. Competitive release through greater generalist enemy impact on natives seems to be an important but understudied mechanism of enemy release, but there is a serious need for experiments involving exclusion of natural enemies in invaded plant communities. With a clearer understanding of the role of enemy release in exotic plant invasions, we can begin to build a comprehensive predictive model of exotic plant invasions.},

The theory is mechanistic and quantitative in nature leading to a variety of testable predictions. 3 We conclude that the elusive nature of the invasion process arises from the fact that it depends upon conditions of resource enrichment or release that have a variety of causes but which occur only intermittently and, to result in invasion, must coincide with availability of invading propagules.},

  abstract = {As a result of climate change, many plants are now flowering measurably earlier than they did in the past. However, some species' flowering times have changed much more than others. Data at the community level can clarify the variation in flowering responses to climate change. In order to determine how North American species' flowering times respond to climate, we analyzed a series of previously unstudied records of the dates of first flowering for over 500 plant taxa in Concord, Massachusetts, USA. These records began with six years of observations by the famous naturalist Henry David Thoreau from 1852 to 1858, continued with 16 years of observations by the botanist Alfred Hosmer in 1878 and 1888?1902, and concluded with our own observations in 2004, 2005, and 2006. From 1852 through 2006, Concord warmed by 2.4$^\circ$C due to global climate change and urbanization. Using a subset of 43 common species, we determined that plants are now flowering seven days earlier on average than they did in Thoreau's times. Plant flowering times were most correlated with mean temperatures in the one or two months just before flowering and were also correlated with January temperatures. Summer?flowering species showed more interannual variation in flowering time than did spring?flowering species, but the flowering times of spring?flowering species correlated more strongly to mean monthly temperatures. In many cases, such as within the genera Betula and Solidago, closely related, co?occurring species responded to climate very differently from one another. The differences in flowering responses to warming could affect relationships in plant communities as warming continues. Common St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) and highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum) are particularly responsive to changes in climate, are common across much of the United States, and could serve as indicators of biological responses to climate change. We discuss the need for researchers to be aware, when using data sets involving multiple observers, of how varying methodologies, sample sizes, and sampling intensities affect the results. Finally, we emphasize the importance of using historical observations, like those of Thoreau and Hosmer, as sources of long?term data and to increase public awareness of biological responses to climate change.},

This observation indicates that extended phenology may be an important invasion mechanism for this system. However, most evidence that extended leaf phenology drives species invasion is anecdotal, and most studies that directly address the role of leaf phenology in invasion focus solely on increased invader growth. Beyond increasing invader growth, extended leaf phenology may drive invader impact on natives by (1) facilitating resource competition through nutrient pre-emption and shading, (2) altering production of secondary chemicals by invasive plants, (3) altering apparent competition dynamics mediated by native herbivores, (4) allowing temporal enemy escape, and (5) altering behaviour of native pollinators. I review current evidence from the literature regarding each of these possible consequences of extended invader phenology and emphasize the need for experimental manipulations to measure the extent to which extended leaf phenology mediates impact on the native community. Understanding the importance of leaf phenology in species invasion will facilitate prevention of future invasions while elucidating the role of seasonality in shaping species interactions.},

Grown seedlings were transplanted into one-square-meter plots within 1-ha blocks located in the centre (no edge), the edge (one edge) and the corner (two edges), and at different distances from the edge towards the interior (i.e. 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 m) of two rectangular fragments (10- and 100-ha in size). Plots were visited once every two months for one year (1992-1993) and thereafter every two years for almost eight years (1993-2001). 3.Overall, results showed that seedling survival, height, leaf number and biotic damage varied over time with the presence of nearby edges and with the distance from the edge. Survival was lower in fragment edges and corners than in centres. Increase in height was similar for all positions within the 100-ha fragment, while in the 10-ha fragment seedling height had a greater increase at the edge and corner than in the centre. Furthermore, survival increased with distance from the edge as did leaf number, while height showed a lower increase closer to the edge than farther away. 4.Regarding biotic damage, for both fragments herbivory was greater at the centres and decreased with edge proximity over time, while leaf-fungal damage was greater at the corners than in the edges and increased significantly over time. Biotic damage was correlated with seedling size. Small seedlings were more susceptible to fungal attack while larger seedlings were so to herbivores. 5.Synthesis.

  abstract = {Invasive plant species are often more successful within introduced areas when compared to their natural ranges. Allelopathy has been suggested as a potential mechanism for this success because invasive plants frequently establish monocultures and may produce allelochemicals evolutionarily novel to the recipient community. However, species are typically tested in isolation making the relative strength of allelopathy difficult to assess. We conducted laboratory bioassays for 10 co-occurring non-native species to determine the relative strength of their allelopathic potential. These species represented a suite of successful invaders within a young forest and were from a variety of plant life forms: trees, lianas, shrubs, and herbs. We determined the germination responses of a target species to a gradient of leaf extract concentrations to assess relative allelopathic potential. The relative strength of germination inhibition was quantified by the slope ($\beta$) of the germination response to plant extract concentration. Ailanthus altissima extract had the greatest inhibitory effect on target species germination out of all 10 species ($\beta$ $\mkern1mu$=$\mkern1mu$ -0.55) while the other tree species, Acer platanoides extract, had small effects on germination ($\beta$ $\mkern1mu$=$\mkern1mu$ -0.14). For lianas, Celastrus orbiculatus extract inhibited the target species ($\beta$ $\mkern1mu$=$\mkern1mu$ -0.28) more than Lonicera japonica extract ($\beta$ $\mkern1mu$=$\mkern1mu$ -0.06). All invasive shrub extracts had very small effects on seed germination ($\beta$ value -0.03 to -0.19). Extracts of the two herbaceous species, Alliaria petiolata and Microstegium vimineum, had very large inhibitory effects ($\beta$ $\mkern1mu$=$\mkern1mu$ -0.37 and -0.38, respectively). In this system, we screened a suite of invasive species for allelopathic potential and determined the relative strength of germination inhibition. Most species, particularly invasive shrubs, did not exhibit sufficient allelopathic potential to suggest allelopathy would occur in the field. Four species, Ailanthus altissima, Alliaria petiolata, C. orbiculatus, and M. vimineum all exhibited strong germination inhibition and warrant additional study in the field.},

Here, we evaluated leaf herbivory of an invasive tree species (Ligustrum lucidum Aiton) in its native and novel ranges, and determined the potential changes in leaf traits that may be associated with the patterns of herbivory. We measured forest structure, damage by herbivores and leaf traits in novel and native ranges, and on the basis of the literature, we identified the common natural herbivores of L. lucidum. We also performed an experiment offering leaves from both ranges to a generalist herbivore (Spodoptera frugiperda). L. lucidum was more abundant and experienced significantly less foliar damage in the novel than in the native range, in spite of the occurrence of several natural herbivores. The reduced lignin content and lower lignin : N ratio in novel leaves, together with the higher herbivore preference for leaves of this origin in the laboratory experiment, indicated lower herbivore resistance in novel than in native populations. The reduced damage by herbivores is not the only factor explaining invasion success, but it may be an important cause that enhances the invasiveness of L. lucidum.},

  abstract = {The mechanisms by which invasive species affect native communities are not well resolved. For example, invasive plants may influence other species through competition, altered ecosystem processes, or other pathways. We investigated one potential mechanism by which invasive plants may harm native species, allelopathy. Specifically, we explored whether native tree species respond differently to potential allelopathic effects of two invasive plant species. We assessed the separate effects of Lolium arundinaceam (tall fescue) and Elaeagnus umbellata (autumn olive) on three common successional tree species: Acer saccharinum (silver maple), Populus deltoides (eastern cottonwood), and Platanus occidentalis (sycamore). Tall fescue and autumn olive are widely planted and highly invasive or persistent throughout North America where they often grow in forest edges, old fields, and other sites colonized by pioneering tree species. In an exploratory greenhouse experiment, we applied aqueous extracts derived from soil, leaf litter, or live leaves to native trees. We compared these treatments to a sterile water control and also to minced leaves leached in water, a common, but potentially less realistic method of testing for allelopathy. For all tree species, minced leaves from tall fescue reduced the probability that seedlings emerged, and minced leaves of autumn olive reduced the number of days to emergence. During other demographic stages, the three native tree species diverged in their responses to the invasive plants. Platanus occidentalis exhibited the widest range of responses, with reduced root biomass due to minced tissue from both invasive species, reduced days to emergence and marginally reduced survival from minced tall fescue, and reduced leaf biomass from tall fescue leaf litter. Populus deltoides appeared insensitive to most extracts, although survival was marginally increased with application of minced or fresh leaf extracts from autumn olive. In addition, minced tall fescue shortened the time to seedling emergence for Acer saccharinum, potentially a positive effect. Overall, results suggest that allelopathy may be one mechanism underlying the negative impacts of tall fescue and autumn olive on other plant species, but that effects can depend strongly upon the source of allelochemicals and the tree species examined.},

Lonicera maackii, an invasive Asian shrub of forests and open areas in eastern and midwestern North America, has devastating effects on understory vegetation, some of which persist even after this shrub is removed. In this study, we explored the potential of aqueous extracts of the leaves and roots of this plant to inhibit seed germination of Impatiens capensis, Alliaria petiolata, Arabidopsis thaliana, and L. maackii in Petri dish bioassays. Both L. maackii root and leaf extracts significantly decreased germination in the three herb species. This inhibitory effect generally increased with increasing extract concentration and was more pronounced with application of leaf extract than root extract. However, when the same extracts were applied to seeds of L. maackii itself, germination was delayed in some cases, but was not significantly reduced by the end of the experiment. Germination of L. maackii seeds even reached significantly higher levels in some extract treatments than in no-extract controls. This implies that L. maackii can successfully inhibit the germination of other plants with few autotoxic effects and may even promote the germination of its own seeds.},

  abstract = {We examined the changes in leaf phenolic chemistry and insect herbivory from saplings of two temperate deciduous species, Liriodendron tulipifera (tulip poplar) and Cornus florida (dogwood), planted in five microenvironments in Gilmer County, Georgia, USA. The experimental design permitted comparisons between saplings grown in an open field, under shade cloth within the field, on the edge between field and forest, in forest understory, and within canopy gaps established within the forest. Half of the trees in each microenvironment were fertilized. Leaves from each tree were sampled at the end of the growing season and 1989 and 1990 and analyzed for toughness, percent dry mass, total phenolics, hydrolyzable tannins, condensed tannins, and insect herbivory (percent leaf area damaged). The shade?tolerant dogwood saplings contained higher levels of total phenolics and hydrolyzable tannins than the shade?intolerant tulip poplar saplings. Dogwood generally had lower levels of herbivory. These results support earlier studies suggesting that slow?growing, shade?tolerant species tend to have higher levels of phenolics and experienced lower levels of herbivory than fast growing, shade?intolerant species. However, dogwood leaves contained lower levels of condensed tannins and were as tough as tulip poplar leaves. Sunlight availability had a significant positive influence on levels of phenolics in both species. Leaf phenolics generally increased with greater insolation from forest to field and when sunlight was greater within field for forest habitats. However, the levels of tannins in dogwood saplings only dropped significantly in the deep shade of the forest. The similar levels of dogwood phenolics in most microenvironments are indicative of the relatively high photosynthetic efficiency of this species in reduced light environments. Overall, these results are consistent with carbon/nutrient balance theory that predicts trade?offs in the allocation of photosynthate from defense to growth as light declines. Levels of insect herbivory and total phenolics were inversely related for dogwood. However, the relationship with tannins was less apparent. Herbivory on tulip poplar was unrelated to changes in phenolics, possibly reflecting the greater chemical diversity of that species. Fertilization increased the biomass of both species, but had no apparent influence on levels of leaf phenolics or insect hervivory. The lack of a fertilization effect was unexpected in light of previous suggestions that fertilization results in reduced phenolics and increased herbivory.},

We aim to test the extent to which land use management, such as setting-aside forest from production, could reduce climate-induced biodiversity impacts for specialist species over large geographical gradients. Location Sweden. Methods We applied ensembles of species distribution models based on citizen science data for six species of red-listed old-forest indicator fungi confined to spruce dead wood. We tested the effect on species habitat suitabilities of alternative climate change scenarios and varying amounts of forest set-aside from production over the coming century. Results With 3.6\% of forest area set-aside from production and assuming no climate change, overall habitat suitabilities for all six species were projected to increase in response to maturing spruce in set-aside forest. However, overall habitat suitabilities for all six species were projected to decline under climate change scenario RCP4.5 (intermediate\textendash{}low emissions), with even greater declines projected under RCP 8.5 (high emissions). Increasing the amount of forest set-aside to 16\% resulted in significant increases in overall habitat suitability, with one species showing an increase. A further increase to 32\% forest set-aside resulted in considerably more positive trends, with three of six species increasing. Main conclusions There is interspecific variation in the importance of future macroclimate and resource availability on species occurrence. However, large-scale conservation measures, such as increasing resource availability through setting aside forest from production, could reduce future negative effects from climate change, and early investment in conservation is likely to reduce the future negative impacts of climate change on specialist species.},

Although resistance is a well-accepted phenomenon, less clear are the processes that contribute most to it, and whether those processes are strong enough to completely repel invaders. Current perceptions of strong, competition-driven biotic resistance stem from classic ecological theory, Elton's formulation of ecological resistance, and the general acceptance of the enemies-release hypothesis. We conducted a meta-analysis of the plant invasions literature to quantify the contribution of resident competitors, diversity, herbivores and soil fungal communities to biotic resistance. Results indicated large negative effects of all factors except fungal communities on invader establishment and performance. Contrary to predictions derived from the natural enemies hypothesis, resident herbivores reduced invasion success as effectively as resident competitors. Although biotic resistance significantly reduced the establishment of individual invaders, we found little evidence that species interactions completely repelled invasions. We conclude that ecological interactions rarely enable communities to resist invasion, but instead constrain the abundance of invasive species once they have successfully established.},

As such, little is known about the persistence of invasions and their long-term impacts on native species. To experimentally evaluate longer-term effects of invasions, we established field plots with native tree and herbaceous species and then invaded half of the plots with the most widespread invasive grass in the eastern United States (Microstegium vimineum). Over 8 years, we quantified invader and native plant biomass, native plant diversity, and tree density and size. Microstegium was dominant during the first 4 years of the experiment, constituting more than 60\% of herbaceous plant biomass in the plots, and native herbaceous biomass was 57\% lower and diversity was 44\% lower in invaded vs. control plots. However, both Microstegium and herbaceous native species declined in later years. By the end of the experiment, Microstegium was only 2\% of community biomass, and there was no difference in native herbaceous biomass in invaded and control plots. We applied a fire treatment in years 6 and 7 to test if repeated disturbance is required to maintain invader dominance and to evaluate how this common management practice in eastern US forests affected invasive and native plants. Tree density was 65\% lower and tree diameters were 28\textendash{}51\% smaller on average in fire-treated compared with control quadrants, resulting in significantly greater light availability in fire-treated areas. Consequently, Microstegium and native herbaceous species biomass increased significantly where fire was applied. However, only native species were persistent, and after 8 years, Microstegium was nearly absent, regardless of the fire treatment. Synthesis. The invasive grass was initially abundant and suppressed native species, but invader decline over time corresponded with succession to native herbaceous species dominance when fire was applied, and to native tree dominance without fire such that after 8 years, the initial effects of invasion were no longer apparent. Thus, our data provide some of the first experimental evidence that while the initial effects of plant invasions can be dramatic, invaders and their impacts may decline over time.},

And, if so, how does this affect their fitness relative to native, non-invasive species? What role might this play in plant invasions? To answer these long-standing questions, we conducted a meta-analysis using data from 75 invasive/non-invasive species pairs. Our analysis shows that invasive species demonstrate significantly higher phenotypic plasticity than non-invasive species. To examine the adaptive benefit of this plasticity, we plotted fitness proxies against measures of plasticity in several growth, morphological and physiological traits to test whether greater plasticity is associated with an improvement in estimated fitness. Invasive species were nearly always more plastic in their response to greater resource availability than non-invasives but this plasticity was only sometimes associated with a fitness benefit. Intriguingly, non-invasive species maintained greater fitness homoeostasis when comparing growth between low and average resource availability. Our finding that invasive species are more plastic in a variety of traits but that non-invasive species respond just as well, if not better, when resources are limiting, has interesting implications for predicting responses to global change.},

  abstract = {Although invasive plants are recognized as a major ecological problem, little is known of the relative importance of plant community characteristics versus landscape context in determining invasibility of communities. We determined the relative importance of community and landscape features of 30 woodlots in influencing the invasion of Lonicera maackii. We sampled woodlots using the point-quarter method and calculated canopy openness and basal areas and densities of shrub, sapling and tree species, as well as woody species richness. We used aerial photos and ArcView GIS to calculate landscape parameters from the same woodlots using a buffer distance of 1500 m. We used logistic and linear regression analyses to determine the community and landscape factors that best explain L. maackii presence and density. We also tested whether woodlot invasion by L. maackii begins at woodlot edges. Presence of L. maackii was significantly explained only by distance from the nearest town (logistic regression, p=0.017); woodlots nearer town were more likely to be invaded. Among invaded woodlots, density of L. maackii was positively related to the amount of edge in the landscape (partial R2=0.592) and negatively related to total tree basal area (partial R2=0.134), number of native woody species (partial R2=0.054), and sapling shade tolerance index (partial R2=0.054). Lonicera maackii in woodlot interiors were not younger than those on the perimeters, leading us to reject the edge-first colonization model of invasion. Our findings reveal that landscape structure is of primary importance and community features of secondary importance in the invasion of L. maackii. This shrub is invading from multiple foci (towns) rather than an advancing front. Connectivity in the landscape (i.e. the number of corridors) did not promote invasion. However, edge habitat was important for invasion, probably due to increased propagule pressure. The community features associated with L. maackii invasion may be indicators of past disturbance.},

  abstract = {Non-native invasive species are often more productive aboveground than co-occurring natives. Because aboveground productivity is closely tied to plant nitrogen (N) uptake and use, high invader leaf productivity should be associated with root growth and plant N use strategies. However, little is known about the above- and belowground carbon (C) and N use strategies of native and invasive plants. We measured shoot and root attributes and soil properties associated with 10 native and 14 non-native invasive forest shrubs and lianas of the Eastern U.S. in a common garden in Syracuse, New York (USA), including leaf growth and chemistry (C, N), root growth, specific root length (SRL), root tissue density, and associated soil C and N concentration, each determined at 2-month intervals (July\textendash{}November). Non-native species had greater leaf and root production, leaf N concentration, and SRL, but lower leaf N resorption rates and root N concentration than natives. Soil N concentration associated with non-natives was significantly lower than that of native species. Our results suggest that greater aboveground productivity of invasive forest species is linked to greater production of fine roots that may increase the capacity of invaders to take up soil resources. In addition, our findings suggest that invaders beget more rapid plant-soil N feedbacks by promoting N cycling compared to the strategy of slow growing native species that emphasizes recycled plant N. Such differences in N use strategy between native and non-native species would significantly impact forest soil nutrient cycling.},

Stronger competitors experienced more negative PSF than weaker competitors when controlling for density (inter- to intraspecific competition), suggesting that PSF could prevent competitive dominance and promote coexistence. When competition was measured against plants growing singly, the strength of competition overwhelmed PSF, indicating that the relative importance of PSF may depend not only on neighbour identity but also density. We evaluate how competition and PSFs might interact across resource gradients; PSF will likely strengthen competitive interactions in high resource environments and enhance facilitative interactions in low-resource environments. Finally, we provide a framework for filling key knowledge gaps and advancing our understanding of how these biotic interactions influence community structure.},

A. beyrichiana), a keystone perennial bunchgrass, is a dominant groundcover species in southeastern United States pine savannas. Although wiregrass flammability as a driver of pine savanna fire regimes is a fundamental paradigm in pine savanna dynamics, no studies have quantified its fuel structure and flammability at the individual bunchgrass level. We studied wiregrass flammability at the Aiken Gopher Tortoise Heritage Preserve in Aiken County, South Carolina, USA. We linked tussock fuel structure characteristics (total biomass, live:dead biomass, mass of perched litter and pine needles, moisture content, and bulk density) to flammability (flaming duration, smoldering duration, and flame length). Flame length was strongly and positively related to wiregrass biomass. Pine needles and other litter fuels perched on wiregrass tussocks were not related to flame length, but increased the duration of flaming and smoldering. Within the ranges evaluated, neither fire weather (relative humidity, wind speed, and air temperature) nor fuel moisture significantly affected tussock flammability. Our results indicate that different fuel structural properties drive separate aspects of wiregrass flammability. Together with litter from pines and other groundcover shrubs and trees, wiregrass modifies fire behavior locally, potentially influencing ecosystem dynamics at larger scales. These results have strong implications for southeastern pine savannas and more broadly where grass-dominated vegetation influences fire regimes.},

Of the 67\% of species pairs in which both intra- and interspecific effects were negative (competitive), intraspecific competition was, on average, four to five-fold stronger than interspecific competition. Of the remaining pairs, 93\% featured intraspecific competition and interspecific facilitation, a situation that stabilises coexistence. The difference between intra- and interspecific effects tended to be larger in observational than experimental data sets, in field than greenhouse studies, and in studies that quantified population growth over the full life cycle rather than single fitness components.

A partial floristic survey using nested plots and survey plots was conducted May\textendash{}July 2016 in longleaf pine woodlands of the Oakmulgee District that were differentially impacted by a 27 April 2011 EF3 tornado and a subsequent salvage harvesting operation. Vascular plants were identified and ranked by frequency of occurrence (rare, occasional, common, and abundant) in three disturbance categories: undisturbed, wind-disturbed, and compound-disturbed (wind-disturbed and salvage-harvested). Overall, 192 plant taxa in 68 families and 137 genera were documented. Plant taxonomic richness was lowest on undisturbed sites (90 taxa), greatest on wind-disturbed sites (160 taxa), and reduced on compounddisturbed sites (126 taxa). Although salvage harvesting reduced taxonomic richness, 46 of the 48 plant taxa unique to unharvested wind-disturbed sites were rare (occurred on $<$10\% of nested plots). Moreover, undisturbed sites had only nine unique taxa, of which eight were rare. Decisions on whether to salvage harvest must consider the ecological significance of these rare plants. Wind- and compound-disturbed areas may recover toward predisturbance conditions, and the floristic list presented here provides the baseline to monitor this succession. The documented floristic composition also provides insight on short-term responses of vascular plants to differential disturbance impacts in an understudied region of the longleaf pine ecosystem.},

  abstract = {Interactions among disturbances are seldom quantified, and how they will be affected by climate change is even more uncertain. In this study, we sought to better understand how interactions among disturbances shift under climate change by applying a process-based landscape disturbance and succession model (LANDIS-II) to project disturbance regimes under climate change in north-central Minnesota, USA. Specifically, we (1) contrasted mortality rates and the extent of disturbance for four individual (single) disturbance regimes (fire, insects, wind, or forest management) vs. all four disturbance regimes operating simultaneously (concurrent) under multiple climate change scenarios and (2) determined how climate change interacts with single and concurrent disturbance regimes to affect carbon stocks and forest composition. Under single disturbance regimes, we found that climate change amplifies mortality, but did not substantially change the overall extent of disturbances. Tree mortality under the concurrent disturbance regime scenario was less than the sum of all single disturbance regimes, providing evidence of significant negative feedbacks among disturbances, particularly under climate change. Finally, we found that climate change was the most critical driver of area harvested (via shifts in species composition), soil carbon, species composition, and diversity, while the disturbance regime (i.e., single or concurrent) had a larger influence on aboveground carbon and the relative dominance of conifers vs. hardwoods. In conclusion, our simulations suggest that disturbance interactions will be strongly mediated by climate change and will produce increasingly negative feedbacks, preventing worst-case disturbance outcomes. Our results underscore the importance of running simulations with multiple disturbances on the landscape concurrently rather than focusing on any one or two disturbances.},

We used a novel comparative approach to analyse four long-term datasets (1995\textendash{}2015) on the incidence of tick-borne diseases in humans and livestock (Lyme disease, anaplasmosis and babesiosis) over a geographic area that covered the whole of Norway. This approach allowed us to separate general (shared vector) and specific (pathogen reservoir host) limiting factors of tick-borne diseases, as well as the role of exposure (shared and non-shared pathogens in different hosts). We found broadly similar patterns of emergence across the four tick-borne diseases. Following initial increases during the first decade of the time series, the numbers of cases peaked at slightly different years and then stabilized or declined in the most recent years. Contrasting spatial patterns of disease incidence were consistent with exposure to ticks being an important factor influencing disease incidence in livestock. Uncertainty regarding the reservoir host(s) of the pathogens causing anaplasmosis and babesiosis prevented a firm conclusion regarding the role of the reservoir host-pathogen distribution. Our study shows that the emergence of tick-borne diseases at northern latitudes is linked to the shared tick vector and that variation in host-pathogen distribution and exposure causes considerable variation in emergence.},

  abstract = {There is no doubt that all vector-borne diseases are very sensitive to climatic conditions. Many such diseases have shown marked increases in both distribution and incidence during the past few decades, just as human-induced climate change is thought to have exceeded random fluctuations. This coincidence has led to the general perception that climate change has driven disease emergence, but climate change is the inevitable backdrop for all recent events, without implying causality. Coincidence and causality can be disentangled using tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) as a test case, based on the excellent long-term data for this medically significant European disease system. Detailed analysis of climate records since 1970 has revealed abrupt temperature increases just prior to the dramatic upsurge in TBE incidence in many parts of central and eastern Europe. Furthermore, the seasonal patterns of this temperature change are such as might have favoured the transmission of TBE virus between co-feeding ticks. Nevertheless, the pattern of climate change is too uniform to explain the marked heterogeneity in the timing and degree of TBE upsurge, for example in different counties within each of the Baltic countries. Recent decreases as well as increases in TBE incidence must also be taken into account. Instead of a single cause, a network of interacting factors, acting synergistically but with differential force in space and time, would generate this epidemiological heterogeneity. From analysis of past and present events, it appears that human behavioural factors have played a more significant role than purely biological enzootic factors, although there is an explicit causal linkage from one to the other. This includes a range of abiotic and biotic environmental factors, together with human behaviour determined by socio-economic conditions. Many of the abrupt changes followed from the shift from planned to market economies with the fall of Soviet rule. Comparisons between eight countries have indeed revealed a remarkable correlation between poverty indicators and the relative degree of upsurge in TBE from 1993. Against this background of longer-term shifts in TBE incidence, sudden spikes in incidence appear to be due to exceptional weather conditions affecting people's behaviour, which have a differential impact depending on socio-economic factors. This new perspective may also help explain the epidemiology of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever around the eastern Mediterranean region, including the current exceptional epidemic in Turkey.},

Reliable records of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) since 1970 show an especially sharp upsurge in cases in Eastern Europe coincident with the end of Soviet rule, including the three Baltic countries, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, where national incidence increased from 1992 to 1993 by 64, 175 and 1,065\%, respectively. At the county level within each country, however, the timing and degree of increase showed marked heterogeneity. Climate has also changed over this period, prompting an almost universal assumption of causality. For the first time, we analyse climate and TBE epidemiology at sufficiently fine spatial and temporal resolution to question this assumption.Methodology/Principal FindingDetailed analysis of instrumental records of climate has revealed a significant step increase in spring-time daily maximum temperatures in 1989. The seasonal timing and precise level of this warming were indeed such as could promote the transmission of TBE virus between larval and nymphal ticks co-feeding on rodents. These changes in climate, however, are virtually uniform across the Baltic region and cannot therefore explain the marked spatio-temporal heterogeneity in TBE epidemiology.Conclusions/SignificanceInstead, it is proposed that climate is just one of many different types of factors, many arising from the socio-economic transition associated with the end of Soviet rule, that have acted synergistically to increase both the abundance of infected ticks and the exposure of humans to these ticks. Understanding the precise differential contribution of each factor as a cause of the observed epidemiological heterogeneity will help direct control strategies.},

  abstract = {The phenology of tick emergence has important implications for the transmission of tick-borne pathogens. A long lag between the emergence of tick nymphs in spring and larvae in summer should increase transmission of persistent pathogens by allowing infected nymphs to inoculate the population of naive hosts that can subsequently transmit the pathogen to larvae to complete the transmission cycle. In contrast, greater synchrony between nymphs and larvae should facilitate transmission of pathogens that do not produce long-lasting infections in hosts. Here, we use 19 years of data on blacklegged ticks attached to small-mammal hosts to quantify the relationship between climate warming and tick phenology. Warmer years through May and August were associated with a nearly three-week advance in the phenology of nymphal and larval ticks relative to colder years, with little evidence of increased synchrony. Warmer Octobers were associated with fewer larvae feeding concurrently with nymphs during the following spring. Projected warming by the 2050s is expected to advance the timing of average nymph and larva activity by 8\textendash{}11 and 10\textendash{}14 days, respectively. If these trends continue, climate warming should maintain or increase transmission of persistent pathogens, while it might inhibit pathogens that do not produce long-lasting infections.},

  abstract = {Wildland fire radiant energy emission is one of the only measurements of combustion that can be made at high temporal and spatial resolutions. Furthermore, spatially and temporally explicit measurements are critical for making inferences about ecological fire effects. Although the correlation between fire frequency and plant biological diversity in frequently burned coniferous forests is well documented, the ecological mechanisms explaining this relationship remains elusive. Uncovering these mechanisms will require highly resolved, spatially explicit fire data (Loudermilk et al. 2012). Here, we describe our efforts at connecting spatial variability in fuels to fire energy release and fire effects using fine scale (1 cm2) longwave infrared (LWIR) thermal imagery. We expected that the observed variability in fire radiative energy release driven by canopy-derived fuels could be the causal mechanism driving plant mortality, an important component of community dynamics. Analysis of fire radiant energy released in several experimental burns documented a close connection among patterns of fire intensity and plant mortality. Our results also confirmed the significance of cones in driving fine-scale spatial variability of fire intensity. Spatially and temporally resolved data from these techniques show promise to effectively link the combustion environment with postfire processes, remote sensing at larger scales, and wildland fire modeling efforts.},

Theory predicts that IV will hinder coexistence but empirical studies have shown that it can facilitate, inhibit, or have a neutral effect. We use a theoretical model to explore the consequences of IV on local and regional species coexistence in the context of spatial environmental structure. Our results show that individual variation can have a positive effect on species coexistence and that this effect will critically depend on the spatial structure of such variation. IV facilitates coexistence when a negative, concave-up relationship between individuals' competitive response and population growth rates propagates to a disproportionate advantage for the inferior competitor, provided that each species specialises in a habitat. While greater variation in the preferred habitat generally fosters coexistence, the opposite is true for non-preferred habitats. Our results reconcile theory with empirical findings.},

  abstract = {Plant pathogens reduce the performance of their hosts and therefore may contribute to ecological mechanisms of coexistence. In Chesson's framework, pathogens contribute to stabilizing mechanisms when they intensify negative intraspecific interactions, such as density-dependent disease. Additionally, pathogens contribute to equalizing mechanisms when they reduce differences in performance among species. Life-history trade-offs predict higher susceptibility to pathogens in rapidly growing species, which could equalize performance among fast- and slow-growing species in the presence of pathogens. In a coastal prairie in California, we studied the impact of leaf diseases on the performance of 17 co-occurring species of Trifolium and Medicago (``clovers''). We transplanted clovers in randomized arrays into the natural prairie community in 3 years of common garden experiments. We quantified infection rates by isolating fungi from leaves, and we measured disease severity as per cent leaf area damaged. In a fungicide experiment, we measured the impact of infection on biomass and survival. We assessed whether disease on transplants was positively related to natural abundance of that species in the surrounding community, which we monitored over 5 years. We assessed life-history trade-offs by testing whether more rapidly growing species were more susceptible to pathogens. Rank abundance of clover species was stable over 5 years despite marked environmental fluctuations. Across hosts, fungal infection was not linearly related to density, although transplants of species that were locally absent showed lower and more variable infection. Disease severity was greater for more abundant species, but in only 1 of 3 years, and response to fungicide was not stronger in more abundant species. As predicted by life-history trade-offs, faster-growing species experienced greater fungal infection. However, the impact of that infection was less negative, not more negative, on faster-growing species. Our results suggest that life-history trade-offs in plant\textendash{}pathogen interactions may influence equalizing mechanisms among species in this guild, but the combined effects of greater infection with greater tolerance may limit rather than promote coexistence. We also found modest evidence that density-dependent disease may contribute to stabilizing mechanisms. Lack of host specificity, rapid evolution of host use and temporal variation in climatic conditions may all influence the role that pathogens play in coexistence of these closely related plants.},

  abstract = {Forest ecosystems characterised by higher tree species diversity have been linked to a reduced susceptibility to pathogens. Conversely, endemic pathogens contribute to forest ecosystem dynamics and process. In the face of global change, however, negative impacts arising from more frequent and severe forest disturbances are increasingly observed. An increase in the susceptibility of Corymbia calophylla, a keystone tree species of southwest Western Australia, to cankers caused by the endemic fungus Quambalaria coyrecup, has emerged in recent decades. Landscape scale assessment of disease incidence has implicated the predisposing role of anthropogenic disturbance, indicating a need for this to be examined at a finer resolution. We assessed the effects of anthropogenic disturbance on the incidence of canker disease caused by Q. coyrecup across a disturbance gradient at 17 forest sites. In addition, we determined the impact of disturbance on tree community composition and stand level structural traits including stem density and stand basal area, and investigated the role of these factors as drivers of canker presence. Canker incidence and associated mortality of C. calophylla increased with anthropogenic disturbance. Disturbed edges showed significantly different overstorey composition from the forest transects. Total stem density increased with increasing disturbance, and disturbed edges contained greater numbers of C. calophylla stems compared to forest transects. There was a much increased basal area of C. calophylla on disturbed edges. Regardless of transect position, an increased incidence of canker resulted on sites with increased C. calophylla basal area. Lastly, increased tree species diversity (as measured by species richness) was associated with decreased canker incidence. We demonstrate that anthropogenic disturbance has altered stand structure and led to an increased susceptibility of C. calophylla to Q. coyrecup, resulting in high disease incidence and mortality of trees on disturbed road edges. Our results highlight the complexity of addressing tree health issues in the presence of multiple global change factors.},

  doi = {10.1111/gcb.14393},
  abstract = {Many global ecosystems have undergone shifts in fire regimes in recent decades, such as changes in fire size, frequency, and/or severity. Recent research shows that increases in fire size, frequency, and severity can lead to long-persisting deforestation, but the consequences of shifting fire regimes for biodiversity of other vegetative organisms (such as understory plants, fungi, and lichens) remain poorly understood. Understanding lichen responses to wildfire is particularly important because lichens play crucial roles in nutrient cycling and supporting wildlife in many ecosystems. Lichen responses to fire have been little studied, and most previous research has been limited to small geographic areas (e.g. studies of a single fire), making it difficult to establish generalizable patterns. To investigate long-term effects of fire severity on lichen communities, we sampled epiphytic lichen communities in 104 study plots across California's greater Sierra Nevada region in areas that burned in five wildfires, ranging from 4 to 16 years prior to sampling. The conifer forest ecosystems we studied have undergone a notable increase in fire severity in recent decades, and we sample across the full gradient of fire severity to infer how shifting fire regimes may influence landscape-level biodiversity. We find that low-severity fire has little to no effect on lichen communities. Areas that burned at moderate and high severities, however, have significantly and progressively lower lichen richness and abundance. Importantly, we observe very little postfire lichen recolonization on burned substrates even more than 15 years after fire. Our multivariate model suggests that the hotter, drier microclimates that occur after fire removes forest canopies may prevent lichen reestablishment, meaning that lichens are not likely to recolonize until mature trees regenerate. These findings suggest that altered fire regimes may cause broad and long-persisting landscape-scale biodiversity losses that could ultimately impact multiple trophic levels.},

  shorttitle = {Quantifying Relative Importance},
  doi = {10.1002/ecs2.2283},
  abstract = {Scientists commonly ask questions about the relative importance of processes and then turn to statistical models for answers. Standardized coefficients are typically used in such situations, with the goal being to compare effects on a common scale. Traditional approaches to obtaining standardized coefficients were developed with idealized Gaussian variables in mind. When responses are binary, complications arise that impact standardization methods. In this paper, we review, evaluate, and propose new methods for standardizing coefficients from models that contain binary outcomes. We first consider the interpretability of unstandardized coefficients and then examine two main approaches to standardization. One approach, which we refer to as the latent-theoretical (LT) method, assumes that underlying binary observations, there exists a latent, continuous propensity linearly related to the coefficients. A second approach, which we refer to as the observed-empirical (OE) method, assumes responses are purely discrete and estimates error variance empirically via reference to a classical R2 estimator. We also evaluate the standard formula for calculating standardized coefficients based on standard deviations. Criticisms of this practice have been persistent, leading us to propose an alternative formula that is based on user-defined ``relevant ranges.'' Finally, we implement all of the above in an open-source package for the statistical software R. Results from simulation studies show that both the LT and OE methods of standardization support a similarly broad range of coefficient comparisons. The LT method estimates effects that reflect underlying latent-linear propensities, while the OE method computes a linear approximation for the effects of predictors on binary responses. The contrast between assumptions for the two methods is reflected in persistently weaker standardized effects associated with OE standardization. Reliance on standard deviations for standardization (the traditional approach) is critically examined and shown to introduce substantial biases when predictors are nonGaussian. The use of relevant ranges in place of standard deviations has the capacity to place LT and OE standardized coefficients on a more comparable scale. As ecologists address increasingly complex hypotheses, especially those that comparing the influences of different controlling factors (e.g., top-down vs. bottomup or biotic vs. abiotic controls), comparable coefficients become necessary for evaluations.},

To study the factors that determine seasonality, a multiyear study at seven sites across the geographic range of I. scapularis systematically collected questing ticks by flagging/dragging, and feeding ticks by capture of their hosts. The observed phenology patterns were consistent with previous studies reporting geographic variation in seasonal tick activity. Predictions of seasonal activity for each site were obtained from an I. scapularis simulation model calibrated using contemporaneous weather data. A range of scenarios for life-cycle processes\textemdash{}including different regimes of temperature-independent behavioral and developmental diapause, variations in temperature\textendash{}development rate relationships, and temperature-dependent tick activity\textemdash{}were used in model formulations. These formulations produced a range of simulations of seasonal activity for each site and were compared against the field observed tick data using negative binomial regression models. Best fit scenarios were chosen for each site on the basis of Akaike's information criterion and regression model parameters. This analysis suggests that temperature-independent diapause mechanisms explain some key observed variations in I. scapularis seasonality, and are responsible in part for geographic variations in I. scapularis seasonality in the United States. However, diapause appears to operate in idiosyncratic ways in different regions of the United States, so further studies on populations in different regions will be needed to enable predictive modeling of climatic and climate change effects on I. scapularis seasonal activity and pathogen transmission.},

  abstract = {The lone star tick, Amblyomma americanum (Linneaus) (Acari:Ixodidae), is the most commonly reported humanbiting tick in the southeastern United States and is a vector for several human and livestock pathogens. Although it is endemic to Florida, little is known about the ecological preferences and current spatial distribution within the state. Using occurrence records of adult A. americanum collected between August 2015 and September 2016, a logistic regression model was used to estimate environmental associations, as well as to predict the distribution of the tick at a one hectare resolution. Occurrence of adult lone star ticks was associated with land cover and bioclimatic variables, namely the presence of forested areas and precipitation seasonality. The estimated spatial distribution indicated that central and northern regions show greater suitability than the southern half of the state. Furthermore, areas predicted to be suitable for the species decreases from north to south with very little area deemed suitable in the far southern reaches of the state. High heterogeneity in the distribution of suitable habitat has implications for the distribution of tick-borne disease cases in the state. The subcounty resolution of the estimated distribution is an improvement over distributions currently published and may better inform the public and state or federal agencies of potential risk of exposure to A. americanum and its associated pathogens.},

Such local-scale information is vital to identify targets for tick population control measures within land management units. We investigated how habitat features predict host-seeking A. americanum adult and nymph abundance within a 12-ha oak-hickory forest plot in the Missouri Ozarks. We trapped ticks using CO2-baited traps at 40 evenly spaced locations for three 24-h periods during the summer of 2015, and we measured biotic and abiotic variables surrounding each location. Of 2,008 A. americanum captured, 1,009 were nymphs, and 999 were adults. We observed spatial heterogeneity in local tick abundance (min = 0 ticks, max = 112 ticks, mean = 16.7 ticks per trap night). Using generalized linear mixed models, we found that both nymphs and adults had greater abundance in valleys as well as on northern-facing aspects. Moreover, nymph abundance was negatively related to temperature variance, while adult abundance had a negative relationship with elevation. These results demonstrate that managers in this region may be able to predict local tick abundance through simple physiognomic factors and use these parameters for targeted management action.},

  abstract = {Elevating concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases are now widely acknowledged as a major cause of global warming. A warmer climate could increase the frequency, duration, and/or severity of drought and, in turn, could alter the composition, structure, and biogeography of forests in many regions. To explore the regional effects of different drought severities on forest regeneration, we investigated changes in sapling growth and density across the southeastern United States under various drought and stand conditions using 1991\textendash{}2005 Forest Health and Monitoring plot data from Alabama, Georgia, and Virginia. Drought effects were examined on three species groups (pine, oak + hickory, and mesophytic species) using the Palmer Drought Severity Index. Stand and site variables, including total basal area, total stand density, tree species richness, slope, and stand age, were used to account for drought effects under varying stand conditions. The oak + hickory and mesophytic species groups exhibited significant reductions in annual growth rate with increasing drought severity. However, no significant difference in annual growth rate was observed within the pine species group. Chi-square analysis showed that annual mortality rate was significantly dependent on drought severity for each species group but annual recruitment rate was only significantly dependent on drought severity for the oak + hickory group. Total basal area, tree species richness, and stand age had a negative effect on growth in one or more species groups. The observed differential dynamics of sapling growth, mortality, and recruitment among species groups may alter the trend of forest regeneration in southeastern U.S. forests because of the predicted increases in intensity and frequency of droughts in the future. The significant effects of stand conditions on drought responses observed in our study also suggest that appropriate forest management strategies may be useful to maintain structure features of understory saplings for southeastern U.S. forests.},

  abstract = {Ecology Letters (2010) 13: 810\textendash{}818 Abstract Host characteristics commonly determine infection risk, but infection can also be mediated by regional- or local-scale variation in the biotic and abiotic environment. Experiments can clarify the relative importance of these factors. We quantified drivers of infection by barley and cereal yellow dwarf viruses (B/CYDV), a group of generalist, vector-borne grass pathogens, at hierarchically nested spatial scales (105\textendash{}1 m) by planting individuals of six common grass species into five Pacific Coast grassland sites spanning 7$^\circ$ of latitude ($>$ 5000 total hosts) and applying a factorial combination of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer. Infection differed most among experimental blocks (102\textendash{}103 m scale), suggesting that local factors control infection risk; infection increased with cover of long-lived hosts and phosphorus, but not nitrogen, fertilization. For B/CYDV, local context more strongly predicts infection risk than host species traits or regional context; such spatially nested experiments can clarify the factors underlying variation in infection risk.},

These projections rarely account for how temporal variation in temperature can systematically modify growth rates relative to projections based on constant temperatures. Here, we tested the hypothesis that population growth rates in fluctuating thermal environments differ from growth rates in constant conditions, and that the differing thermal performance curves (TPCs) can be predicted quantitatively. With experimental populations of the green alga Tetraselmis tetrahele, we show that nonlinear averaging techniques accurately predicted increased as well as decreased population growth rates in fluctuating thermal regimes relative to constant thermal regimes. We extrapolate from these results to project critical temperatures for population growth and persistence of 89 phytoplankton species in naturally variable thermal environments. These results advance our ability to predict population dynamics in the context of global change.},

  abstract = {Aim Large disturbances increasingly shape the world's forests. Concomitantly, increasing amounts of forest are subject to salvage logging. Understanding and managing the world's forests thus increasingly hinges upon understanding the combined effects of natural disturbance and logging disturbance, including interactions so far unnoticed. Here, we use recent advances in disturbance-interaction theory to disentangle and describe the mechanisms through which natural disturbance (e.g., wildfire, insect outbreak or windstorm) can interact with anthropogenic disturbance (logging) to produce unanticipated effects. We also explore to what extent such interactions have been addressed in empirical research globally. Insights First, many ecological responses to salvage logging likely result from interaction modifications\textemdash{}i.e., from non-additive effects\textendash{} between natural disturbance and logging. However, based on a systematic review encompassing 209 relevant papers, we found that interaction modifications have been largely neglected. Second, salvage logging constitutes an interaction chain because natural disturbances increase the likelihood, intensity and extent of subsequent logging disturbance due to complex socio-ecological interactions. Both interaction modifications and interaction chains can be driven by nonlinear responses to the severity of each disturbance. We show that, whereas many of the effects of salvage logging likely arise from the multiple kinds of disturbance interactions between natural disturbance and logging, they have mostly been overlooked in research to date. Conclusions Interactions between natural disturbance and logging imply that increasing disturbances will produce even more disturbance, and with unknown characteristics and consequences. Disentangling the pathways producing disturbance interactions is thus crucial to guide management and policy regarding naturally disturbed forests.},

Risk of tick attachment to park visitors was also assessed relative to tick abundance from several habitats. Tick collections consisted of weekly cloth drag samples obtained from ground and emergent vegetation along a deer trail, a walking trail located in a 3-mo-old control burned area of forest, a nonburned walking trail, picnic area, and campsites. Sampling was conducted from February 1994 through February 1996. Ticks collected during the study were as follows in descending order of abundance: Ixodes scapularis Say, Amblyomma americanum (L.), A. maculatum Koch, and Dermacentor variabilis (Say). Signi\TH{}cantly more (Ͻ0.05) adult ticks were recovered from vegetation compared with ground samples only for I. scapularis. Adult questing I. scapularis were collected from October through May (peak December). A. americanum adults were collected from March through August (peak May). Adult A. maculatum were collected during August and September and adult D. variabilis were collected July and August. Larval and nymphal stages of questing A. americanum were collected from June through November (peak July) and February through October (peak September), respectively. A. maculatum nymphs were collected from February through April, June, and September (peak March). No nymphs of I. scapularis were collected. Only four larvae of D. variabilis were collected during the study, all during February 1995. No I. scapularis or A. maculatum larvae were collected from vegetation or ground drags. The greatest risk for tick attachment was in campsites where Ϸ60\% of all adult and nymphal host-seeking ticks were collected. The next greatest risk area was the walking trail located in the control burned area where an additional 28\% of ticks were obtained.},

Schwilk (2015) proposed a flammability framework with only two axes: total heat release and rate of spread. Pausas et al. (2017) modified this framework by standardizing the heat release axis by fuel load, and adding a third axis of fuel ignitability. We tested these frameworks using data from a field experiment that quantified flammability metrics and survival of Callitris intratropica saplings in relation to fuel type (grass, litter, and mixed grass and litter, all air-dried) and fuel load. Principal components analysis showed PC1 was closely aligned with rate of combustion, flame height and temperature, and PC2 was aligned with duration of combustion. The Schwilk framework separated the fuel types according to rate of spread, and fuel loads according to total heat release. The Pausas framework was less useful in describing community-scale flammability because it removed the effects of fuel load, and there was no support for adding the ignitability axis. Both frameworks successfully predicted sapling mortality, an indicator of fire severity. In addition, the three flammability strategies proposed by Pausas et al. were not well-supported because they assumed unrealistically low heat release by `fast-flammable' fuels. We conclude that the Schwilk framework is useful for conceptualizing community-scale flammability and facilitates modelling for fire management purposes, and exploration of evolutionary relationships.},

Current research increasingly integrates ecology and evolution over a range of timescales, but our common conceptual framework for understanding species coexistence requires better incorporation of evolutionary processes. Here, we focus on the idea of evolutionarily stable communities (ESCs), which are theoretical endpoints of evolution in a community context. We use ESCs as a unifying framework to highlight some important but under-appreciated theoretical results, and we review empirical research relevant to these theoretical predictions. We explain how, in addition to generating diversity, evolution can also limit diversity by reducing the effectiveness of coexistence mechanisms. The coevolving traits of competing species may either diverge or converge, depending on whether the number of species in the community is low (undersaturated) or high (oversaturated) relative to the ESC. Competition in oversaturated communities can lead to extinction or neutrally coexisting, ecologically equivalent species. It is critical to consider trait evolution when investigating fundamental ecological questions like the strength of different coexistence mechanisms, the feasibility of ecologically equivalent species, and the interpretation of different patterns of trait dispersion.},

Under future climate projections, we predicted a modest increase in the overall area suitable for malaria transmission, but a net decrease in the most suitable area. Combined with human population density projections, our maps suggest that areas with temperatures suitable for year-round, highest-risk transmission will shift from coastal West Africa to the Albertine Rift between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda, whereas areas with seasonal transmission suitability will shift toward sub-Saharan coastal areas. Mapping temperature suitability places important bounds on malaria transmissibility and, along with local level demographic, socioeconomic, and ecological factors, can indicate where resources may be best spent on malaria control.},

However, there are few ecologically based frameworks for integrating these data into meaningful metrics of biodiversity change. Here, I describe how concepts of pattern and scale in ecology could be used to design such a framework. I review three core topics: the role of scale in measuring and modelling biodiversity patterns with EO, scale-dependent challenges linking in situ and EO data and opportunities to apply concepts of pattern and scale to EO to improve biodiversity mapping. From this analysis emerges an actionable approach for measuring, monitoring and forecasting biodiversity change, highlighting key opportunities to establish EO as the backbone of global-scale, science-driven conservation.},

However, synchrony can vary with timescale. We demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that the timescale-specificity of environmental correlation affects the overall magnitude and timescale-specificity of synchrony, and that these effects are modified by population dispersal. Our laboratory experiments linked populations of flour beetles by changes in habitat size and dispersal. Linear filter theory, applied to a metapopulation model for the experimental system, predicted the observed timescale-specific effects. The timescales at which environmental covariation occurs can affect the population dynamics of species in fragmented habitats.},

Counter-intuitively, many trees do not die during the drought itself. Indeed, observations globally have documented that trees often grow for several years after drought before mortality. A combination of meta-analysis and tree physiological models demonstrate that optimal carbon allocation after drought explains observed patterns of delayed tree mortality and provides a predictive recovery framework. Specifically, post-drought, trees attempt to repair water transport tissue and achieve positive carbon balance through regrowing drought-damaged xylem. Furthermore, the number of years of xylem regrowth required to recover function increases with tree size, explaining why drought mortality increases with size. These results indicate that tree resilience to drought-kill may increase in the future, provided that CO2 fertilisation facilitates more rapid xylem regrowth.},

Although disease risks are occasionally mentioned in AM debates, current regulations or best practices that reduce or mitigate these complex risks are generally lacking in North America. We use the ``Disease Triangle'', a foundational framework in pathology, to illustrate pathways through which AM may impact disease emergence, to identify knowledge gaps, and to suggest best practices to reduce disease risks. We highlight empirical examples in which altering pathogen distributions, host communities, and environment have historically resulted in costly and ecologically damaging diseases in plants. Although guidelines to reduce disease risks in AM are generally lacking, policies governing endangered species, invasive species, and disease management can provide starting points for a more comprehensive policy. We use examples from the United States to identify key strengths and weaknesses that can inform regulations to reduce disease risks associated with AM. We argue that consideration of disease motivates policy development that incorporates improved risk assessments, agency coordination, and accountability mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Cogongrass [Imperata cylindrica (L.) Beauv.] is a warm-season, rhizomatous grass native to southeast Asia that has invaded thousands of hectares in the southeastern United States. Its negative impacts on pine forests have been well documented, and aggressive control is widely recommended. Although repeated herbicide treatments are effective for suppression, integrated strategies of prescribed burning coupled with herbicide treatment and revegetation are lacking in pine systems. In particular, longleaf pine forests, which are typically open, fire-dependent, communities, are highly susceptible to cogongrass, which is a pyrogenic species. To address management goals for cogongrass control and herbaceous restoration in longleaf pine forests better, field studies were conducted in southwestern Alabama from 2010 to 2012. Two longleaf pine forests with near-monotypic stands of cogongrass in the understory were selected for study. Treatments included combinations of winter prescribed fire, spring and fall glyphosate herbicide treatments, and seeding a mix of native, herbaceous species. Data were collected for three growing seasons following study initiation, and included seasonal herbaceous species cover and final cogongrass shoot and rhizome biomass. Species richness and diversity were calculated and analyzed to ascertain treatment effects over the duration of the study. Burning slightly improved cogongrass control with glyphosate, but had no effect on total cover, species richness, or species diversity. Three glyphosate treatments reduced total vegetative cover and nearly eliminated cogongrass cover, shoot, and rhizome biomass. Glyphosate and glyphosate + seeding also increased herbaceous species richness and diversity. However, aboveground productivity in treated plots was significantly lower than productivity in the untreated control, which was almost exclusively cogongrass. These studies indicate that glyphosate and integrated strategies utilizing glyphosate and seeding are very useful for cogongrass management and increasing herbaceous species richness and diversity in longleaf pine. Nomenclature: Glyphosate, cogongrass, Imperata cylindrica (L.) Beauv., longleaf pine, Pinus palustris Mill. Management Implications: Cogongrass is a serious threat to southeastern pine ecosystems. Although numerous control studies have been conducted, information is still lacking for cogongrass management in longleaf pine. With longleaf pine, many land managers want to recreate mixed pine/open savannah conditions with a species-rich herbaceous understory. However, cogongrass is a significant obstacle to that goal, as it forms near-monotypic stands beneath longleaf pine that are of little value. To address this problem, we tested multiple integrated methods, including prescribed burning, glyphosate treatment, and seeding native herbaceous species. We found that glyphosate treatment following prescribed burning provided a minor but significant increase in cogongrass control compared to glyphosate-treated, unburned plots. However, the effect was short-lived and not useful when follow-up glyphosate treatments were applied. Glyphosate treatment combined with seeding native species generally increased cover, species richness, and diversity compared to glyphosate treatment alone. Burning and seeding without glyphosate treatment was ineffective, as cogongrass quickly recovered. In summary, we found that glyphosate treatment was critical for cogongrass control and improvements in native species richness and diversity.},

  abstract = {The impacts of climatic changes on forests may appear gradually on time scales of years to centuries due to the long generation times of trees. Consequently, current forest extent may not reflect current climatic patterns. In contrast with these lagged responses, abrupt transitions in forests under climate change may occur in environments where alternative vegetation states are influenced by disturbances, such as fire. The Klamath forest landscape (northern California and southwest Oregon, USA) is currently dominated by high biomass, biodiverse temperate coniferous forests, but climate change could disrupt the mechanisms promoting forest stability (e.g. growth, regeneration and fire tolerance). Using a landscape simulation model, we estimate that about one-third of the Klamath forest landscape (500,000\,ha) could transition from conifer-dominated forest to shrub/hardwood chaparral, triggered by increased fire activity coupled with lower post-fire conifer establishment. Such shifts were widespread under the warmer climate change scenarios (RCP 8.5) but were surprisingly prevalent under the climate of 1949\textendash{}2010, reflecting the joint influences of recent warming trends and the legacy of fire suppression that may have enhanced conifer dominance. Our results demonstrate that major forest ecosystem shifts should be expected when climate change disrupts key stabilizing feedbacks that maintain the dominance of long-lived, slowly regenerating trees.},

  abstract = {We synthesize findings from one of the world's largest and longest-running experimental investigations, the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP). Spanning an area of $\sim$1000 km2 in central Amazonia, the BDFFP was initially designed to evaluate the effects of fragment area on rainforest biodiversity and ecological processes. However, over its 38-year history to date the project has far transcended its original mission, and now focuses more broadly on landscape dynamics, forest regeneration, regional- and global-change phenomena, and their potential interactions and implications for Amazonian forest conservation. The project has yielded a wealth of insights into the ecological and environmental changes in fragmented forests. For instance, many rainforest species are naturally rare and hence are either missing entirely from many fragments or so sparsely represented as to have little chance of long-term survival. Additionally, edge effects are a prominent driver of fragment dynamics, strongly affecting forest microclimate, tree mortality, carbon storage and a diversity of fauna. Even within our controlled study area, the landscape has been highly dynamic: for example, the matrix of vegetation surrounding fragments has changed markedly over time, succeeding from large cattle pastures or forest clearcuts to secondary regrowth forest. This, in turn, has influenced the dynamics of plant and animal communities and their trajectories of change over time. In general, fauna and flora have responded differently to fragmentation: the most locally extinction-prone animal species are those that have both large area requirements and low tolerance of the modified habitats surrounding fragments, whereas the most vulnerable plants are those that respond poorly to edge effects or chronic forest disturbances, and that rely on vulnerable animals for seed dispersal or pollination. Relative to intact forests, most fragments are hyperdynamic, with unstable or fluctuating populations of species in response to a variety of external vicissitudes. Rare weather events such as droughts, windstorms and floods have had strong impacts on fragments and left lasting legacies of change. Both forest fragments and the intact forests in our study area appear to be influenced by larger-scale environmental drivers operating at regional or global scales. These drivers are apparently increasing forest productivity and have led to concerted, widespread increases in forest dynamics and plant growth, shifts in tree-community composition, and increases in liana (woody vine) abundance. Such large-scale drivers are likely to interact synergistically with habitat fragmentation, exacerbating its effects for some species and ecological phenomena. Hence, the impacts of fragmentation on Amazonian biodiversity and ecosystem processes appear to be a consequence not only of local site features but also of broader changes occurring at landscape, regional and even global scales.},

  abstract = {Tick-borne diseases are increasing worldwide and have a progressively negative impact on human health. The black-legged tick, Ixodes scapularis, is the known vector of several emerging tick-borne diseases. To effectively manage diseases requires enhanced knowledge of the interactions of the tick, its hosts, and the environment. Modeling approaches may offer a way to evaluate vector control strategies since it is impossible to conduct largescale experiments in natural settings. Therefore, we created the first spatially explicit individual-based tick interaction model (SEIB-TIM) that is designed from the perspective of the tick to examine the processes through which I. scapularis populations are maintained. Using a two-host wildlife community consisting of white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), we parameterized our model so that I. scapularis infestation rates for P. leucopus are within the range of those reported in field studies. Once our model (SEIB-TIM) accurately simulated the interactions between I. scapularis, wildlife hosts, and the environment, we evaluated its robustness to parameter uncertainty using both global and local sensitivity analyses. Lastly, we related changes in model parameters to I. scapularis life-history traits to understand how those changes affected the maintenance of I. scapularis populations. We found that of the model parameters we examined, increasing mouse grooming by 10\% reduced the total questing nymph population by 30\% in ten years. In addition, a 10\% reduction in deer grooming is capable of reducing the questing larvae population by 36\% and questing nymph population by 35\%. This result indicates that management interventions aimed at decreasing the number of larval ticks that can successfully feed on mice in addition to targeting the reproductive stage of the ticks lifecycle can potentially reduce tick populations. We therefore conclude that effective management efforts should be aimed at multiple stages in the ticks life cycle and enacted for the long term. The maintenance of tick populations can be better understood and controlling mechanisms identified when incorporating information on all components of the tick life-cycle into the model. This SEIB-TIM model serves as the foundation for a more complex model with additional host species as well as tick-borne pathogens.},

Moreover, the most frequently measured aspect of diversity \textendash{} species richness \textendash{} was poorly correlated with other measures of diversity. Second, we collated studies that included spatial scale in their estimates of biodiversity change in response to ecological drivers and found frequent and strong scale-dependence, including nearly 10\% of studies which showed that biodiversity changes switched directions across scales. Having established the complexity of empirical biodiversity comparisons, we describe a synthesis of methods based on rarefaction curves that allow more explicit analyses of spatial and sampling effects on biodiversity comparisons. We use a case study of nutrient additions in experimental ponds to illustrate how this multi-dimensional and multi-scale perspective informs the responses of biodiversity to ecological drivers.},

Here, we show how spatial coexistence theory can be adapted to provide a mathematical framework for understanding species persistence in competitive communities under climate change. We first show how the spatial low-density growth rate provides the relevant metric of species persistence along a climate gradient. We then analyse a model of multiple migrating competitors to show how mechanisms contributing to low-density growth rates quantify the effect of different competitive processes on persistence, and how these processes change in strength with species' asynchronous migration under climate change. Finally, we outline the empirical utility of the framework, showing how the theory can scale up from local measurements of species performance and competitive interactions to range-scale metrics of persistence. Treating species' range dynamics as a geographical-scale coexistence problem presents its own set of challenges, but building from a well-established body of theory may greatly improve the predictability of species persistence in competitive communities under climate change.},

Increasing propagule size enhances establishment probability primarily by lessening effects of demographic stochasticity, whereas propagule number acts primarily by diminishing impacts of environmental stochasticity. A continuing rain of propagules, particularly from a variety of sources, may erase or vitiate the expected genetic bottleneck for invasions initiated by few individuals (as most are), thereby enhancing likelihood of survival. For a few species, recent molecular evidence suggests ongoing propagule pressure aids an invasion to spread by introducing genetic variation adaptive for new areas and habitats. This phenomenon may also explain some time lags between establishment of a non-native species and its spread to become an invasive pest.},

  abstract = {Cogongrass is a weed throughout the tropics and subtropics. Introductions early this century have spread into forests, rangelands, reclaimed mined areas, roadsides, and natural ecosystems in the southeastern United States. Vegetative reproduction is the primary mechanism for survival and local spread, and sexually produced seeds of this obligate outcrossing species provide natural long-distance dispersal. Highly germinable (- 90\%) seeds have no dormancy, though spikelet fill may be low (c 40\%) in natural populations. Early seedling establishment, prior to rhizome development, is low ($<$ 20\%), occurring in areas with little competition; ? 75\% bahiagrass sod cover is required to prevent cogongrass seedling establishment. Imazapyr and glyphosate are the most effective herbicides for cogongrass control. Younger cogongrass shoots are very susceptible to these herbicides; however, longer term control of adult plants requires translocation and thereby control of the rhizomes. Autumn applications of glyphosate and imazapyr provided greatest suppression of rhizome regrowth. Effective cogongrass management options exist and depend on integrating several control strategies. Mechanical control alone provides short-term control, whereas multiple discings plus herbicide application provide longer term control. Some combinations of herbicide, discing, and revegetation with desirable plant species provide excellent control. Because of the large geographic area infested with cogongrass and the often economically and environmentally unacceptable management techniques, biological control organisms also should be researched.},

  abstract = {Pathogen infection is common in wild plants and animals, and may regulate their populations. If pathogens have narrow host ranges and increase with the density of their favored hosts, they may promote host species diversity by suppressing common species to the benefit of rare species. Yet, because many pathogens infect multiple co-occurring hosts, they may not strongly respond to the relative abundance of a single host species. Are natural communities dominated by specialized pathogens that respond to the relative abundance of a specific host or by pathogens with broad host ranges and limited responses to the relative abundance of single host? The answer determines the potential for pathogens to promote host coexistence, as often hypothesized, or to have negligible or even negative effects on host coexistence. We lack a systematic understanding of the impacts, identities, and host ranges of pathogens in natural communities. Here we characterize a community of foliar fungal pathogens and evaluate their host specificity and fitness impacts in a California grassland community of native and exotic species. We found that most of the commonly isolated fungal pathogens were multi-host, with intermediate to low specialization. The amount of pathogen damage each host experienced was independent of host species local relative abundance. Despite pathogen sharing among the host species, fungal communities slightly differed in composition across host species. Plants with high pathogen damage tended to have lower seed production but the relationship was weak, suggesting limited fitness impacts. Moreover, seed production was not dependent on the local relative abundance of each plant species, suggesting that stabilizing coexistence mechanisms may operate at larger spatial scales in this community. Because foliar pathogens in this grassland community are multi-host and have small fitness impacts, they are unlikely to promote negative frequency dependence or plant species coexistence in this system. Still, given that pathogen community composition differentiates across host species, some more subtle feedbacks between host relative abundance and pathogen community composition, damage, and fitness impacts are possible, which could, in turn, promote either coexistence or competitive exclusion.},

  abstract = {Natural enemies can be a powerful force when structuring natural communities, and in facilitating or preventing species coexistence depending on the nature of the trophic interaction. In particular, ``keystone'' predators can promote species coexistence, provided they preferentially attack the competitively dominant species. However, it is not clear whether parasites can play a similar structuring role; parasites typically form chronic associations with their victims, reducing their fitness (i.e., fecundity) rather than survival, and allowing infected hosts to remain viable competitors within the community. Therefore the density-dependent suppression of the host is likely to be more subtle than that due to predation. Using a series of simple population-dynamic models we show that specialist parasites can facilitate species coexistence, although possibly less so than predators. These results contrast with those typically found with models of generalist parasites, which can reduce the likelihood of species coexistence through apparent competition. In addition, we show that the likelihood of parasite-facilitated species coexistence depends greatly on the specific type of parasite. In particular, macroparasites (e.g., parasitic helminths) may be less likely to facilitate species coexistence than microparasites (e.g., viruses or bacteria) due to their typically highly aggregated distribution amongst their hosts. Furthermore, species coexistence is more likely if the parasite is relatively benign to its host. Parasitism by apparently ``harmless'' specialist parasites may provide an important but overlooked factor in the maintenance of species diversity, facilitating species invasions into new communities and the emergence of novel infectious diseases.},

However, it remains unclear how environmental variation and consumers interact to determine species diversity. Here, I use a model based on California annual grassland plants to show that a generalist pathogen with no host specificity can enhance the positive effect of environmental variability on diversity. The model predicts that pathogens can promote diversity by increasing the covariance between the environment and competition, enhancing the storage effect. However, pathogen impacts depend on life history. Pathogens that infect germinating seeds or plants tend to increase the storage effect, whereas those that infect dormant seeds can undermine the storage effect by eliminating population buffering during unfavorable years. These results suggest that pathogens may mediate plant responses to environmental variability and change, and in doing so may maintain diversity.},

  abstract = {In many forested ecosystems, the architecture and functional ecology of certain tree species define forest structure and their species-specific traits control ecosystem dynamics. Such foundation tree species are declining throughout the world due to introductions and outbreaks of pests and pathogens, selective removal of individual taxa, and over-harvesting. Through a series of case studies, we show that the loss of foundation tree species changes the local environment on which a variety of other species depend; how this disrupts fundamental ecosystem processes, including rates of decomposition, nutrient fluxes, carbon sequestration, and energy flow; and dramatically alters the dynamics of associated aquatic ecosystems. Forests in which dynamics are controlled by one or a few foundation species appear to be dominated by a small number of strong interactions and may be highly susceptible to alternating between stable states following even small perturbations. The ongoing decline of many foundation species provides a set of important, albeit unfortunate, opportunities to develop the research tools, models, and metrics needed to identify foundation species, anticipate the cascade of immediate, short- and long-term changes in ecosystem structure and function that will follow from their loss, and provide options for remedial conservation and management.},

These direct tests are supported by observations of the role of pathogens in generating the productivity gains from manipulations of plant diversity and by evidence that escape from native pathogens contributes to success of introduced plant species. Further work is necessary to test the role of pathogen dynamics in large-scale patterns of plant diversity and range limits, the robustness of coexistence to coevolutionary dynamics, the contribution of different pathogens, and the role of pathogens in plant succession.},

A number of outcomes are possible: coexistence of both hosts with the pathogen, coexistence of both hosts without the pathogen, the predictable elimination of one host by the other, which then remains with the pathogen, and the elimination of either host by the other, contingent on initial densities. However, whereas without self-regulation coexistence of both hosts with their shared pathogen can only be achieved by the partitioning of enemy-free space, with self-regulation there is a wider range of paths, including coexistence mediated by the hosts' resources (analogous to "exploitermediated coexistence"), coexistence mediated by interspecific transmission, and coexistence arising when elements of these other mechanisms are combined. Also, a more affected, "regulated-alone" host can eliminate a less affected, "nonregulated-alone" host, but not vice versa; whereas without self-regulation only the opposite outcome is possible. The incorporation of self-regulation adds a necessary element of realism.},

However, theoretical investigation of such systems has been hindered by the onset of algebraic intractability with the increase in system dimensionality. In this paper we circumvent this problem by using a geometric approach in which arrays of bifurcation maps are constructed, each map being structured by the set of (bifurcation) points in parameter space at which qualitative changes in system behaviour take place. From these maps can be compiled a concise catalogue of the possible modes of system behaviour, enabling an investigation of the interaction of apparent and direct competitive forces to be carried out. Of importance is the identification of those situations where increasing one or both of these competitive forces leads to a change in the stability state. The maps provide an efficient way of determining whether, and, if so, under what conditions, specific modes of behaviour are allowed by the model. Two field phenomena of particular interest, discussed in the paper, are host invasion and dominance reversal resulting from the introduction of the pathogen into a directly competitive system.},

However, even closely related species may exhibit different responses to ocean acidification and less is known about the drivers that shape such variation in different species. Here, we examine the drivers of physiological performance under ocean acidification in a group of five species of turf-forming coralline algae. Specifically, quantitating the relative weight of evidence for each of ten hypotheses, we show that variation in coralline calcification and photosynthesis was best explained by allometric traits. Across ocean acidification conditions, larger individuals (measured as noncalcified mass) had higher net calcification and photosynthesis rates. Importantly, our approach was able to not only identify the aspect of size that drove the performance of coralline algae, but also determined that responses to ocean acidification were not dependent on species identity, evolutionary relatedness, habitat, shape, or structural composition. In fact, we found that failure to test multiple, alternative hypotheses would underestimate the generality of physiological performances, leading to the conclusion that each species had different baseline performance under ocean acidification. Testing among alternative hypotheses is an essential step toward determining the generalizability of experiments across taxa and identifying common drivers of species responses to global change.},

Several approaches for addressing over-dispersion have been developed (e.g., negative binomial distribution), but methods for including both under-dispersion and over-dispersion have been largely overlooked. We provide three specific examples drawn from life-history theory, spatial ecology, and community ecology, and illustrate the use of the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (CMP) distribution as compared to other common models for count data. We find that where equi-dispersion is violated, the CMP distribution performs significantly better than the Poisson distribution, as assessed by information criteria that account for the CMP's additional distribution parameter. The Conway-Maxwell-Poisson distribution has seen rapid development in other fields such as risk analysis and linguistics, but is relatively unknown in the ecological literature. In addition to providing a more flexible exponential distribution for count data that is easily integrated into generalized linear models, the CMP allows ecologists to focus on the magnitude of under- or over-dispersion as opposed to the simple rejection of the equi-dispersion null hypothesis. By demonstrating its suitability in a variety of common ecological applications, we hope to encourage its wider adoption as a flexible alternative to the Poisson.},

  abstract = {1. We introduce a novel method that analyses environmental filtering of plant species in a geographic and phylogenetic context. By connecting species traits with phylogeny, traits with environment, and environment with geography, this comprehensive approach partitions the ecological and evolutionary processes that influence community assembly. 2. Our analysis extends RLQ ordination, which connects site attributes in matrix R (here environmental variables and spatial positions) with species attributes in matrix Q (here biological traits and phylogenetic positions), through the composition of sites in terms of species presences or abundances (matrix L). This methodology, which explores and identifies environmental filters that organize communities, was developed to answer four questions: which combinations of trait states are filtered by the environment, which lineages are affected by these filters, which environmental variables contribute to the assemblage of local communities and where do these filters act? 3. At La Mafragh in north-eastern Algeria, our approach shows that plant species traits were distributed according to environmental filters associated with a salinity gradient. Traits associated with the salinity gradient were convergent among Juncaceae, Cyperaceae and Amaranthaceae. The observed phylogenetic and trait patterns were related to how species survived the xeric season. Juncaceae and Cyperaceae, being perennials and anemogamous, tolerate the xeric hot season by restricting their range to the humid centre of the study area (where conditions are close to a subtropical climate). Several Amaranthaceae species co-occur with the Juncaceae and Cyperaceae in two areas with the highest salinity. Most dicots were observed at higher elevations (up to 7 m a.s.l.), had hairy structures that can retain water and reflect solar radiation and were mostly annual or biennial, completing their life cycle before the onset of the xeric season. 4. Synthesis. Our methodology describes environmental filters in terms of identified combinations of traits and environmental factors. It allows spatial and phylogenetic signals to be determined by identifying convergent and conserved patterns in the evolution of traits and spatial scales that structured the environment. Our statistical framework is generic and can be readily extended to a wide range of exciting issues, such as host-parasite, plant-pollinator and predator\textendash{}prey interactions.},

One way to tell is to compare total species counts in geographic regions to average counts in ecological samples falling within those regions. If species richness is limited regionally, then the relationship should be curvilinear even in a log-log space. Global sets of samples including trees and 10 groups of animals are analysed to test this hypothesis. Most relationships are indeed curvilinear. To explain these patterns, a simple model is proposed that invokes biotic interaction-limited speciation or immigration rates combined with extinction or extirpation rates that fall as the number of occupied patches increases. Local and regional richness come into balance as the rates trade off, causing global richness to also be limited. Surprisingly, however, the data for trees break the pattern, suggesting that the great adaptive radiation of seed plants may still be unfolding.},

Moreover, there has been limited theoretical investigation into how animal movement behavior interacts with the spatial organization of resources (e.g., clustered, random, uniform) across a landscape to affect infectious disease dynamics. Importantly, spatial heterogeneity of resources can sometimes lead to nonlinear or counterintuitive outcomes depending on the host and pathogen system. There is a clear need to develop a general theoretical framework that could be used to create testable predictions for specific host\textendash{}pathogen systems. Here, we develop an individual-based model integrated with movement ecology approaches to investigate how host movement behaviors interact with landscape heterogeneity (in the form of various levels of resource abundance and clustering) to affect pathogen dynamics. For most of the parameter space, our results support the counterintuitive idea that fragmentation promotes pathogen persistence, but this finding was largely dependent on perceptual range of the host, conspecific density, and recovery rate. For simulations with high conspecific density, slower recovery rates, and larger perceptual ranges, more complex disease dynamics emerged, and the most fragmented landscapes were not necessarily the most conducive to outbreaks or pathogen persistence. These results point to the importance of interactions between landscape structure, individual movement behavior, and pathogen transmission for predicting and understanding disease dynamics.},

We used ensemble classification and regression trees to examine the relationships between fuel characteristics and fire temperature dynamics. Fire behaviour was best predicted by characterising fuelbed heterogeneity and continuity across multiple plots of similar fire intensity, where impacts from plot-to-plot variation in fuel, fire and weather did not overwhelm the effects of fuels. The individual plot-level results revealed the significance of specific fuel types (e.g. bare soil, pine leaf litter) as well as the spatial configuration of fire. This was the first known study to link the importance of fuelbed continuity and the heterogeneity associated with fuel types to fire behaviour at metre to submetre scales and provides the next step in understanding the complex responses of vegetation to fire behaviour.},

  abstract = {Multi-scale studies ostensibly allow us to form generalizations regarding the importance of scale in understanding ecosystem function, and in the application of the same ecological principles across a series of spatial domains. Achieving such generalizations, however, requires consistency among multi-scale studies not only in across-scale sample design, but also in basic rationales used in the choice of observational scale, including both grain and extent. To examine the current state of this science, here we review 79 multi-scale wildlife-habitat studies published since 1993. We summarize rationales used in scale choice and also review key differences in scale-specific experimental design among studies. We found on average that 70\% of the observational scales employed in wildlife-habitat research were chosen arbitrarily with no biological connection to the system of study, and with no consideration regarding domains of scale for either dependent or independent variables. Further, we found it common to change either both grain and extent, or the entire suite of independent variables across scales, making cross-scale extrapolations and generalizations impossible. We discuss these sampling limitations by clarifying the differences between multi-scale versus multi-design studies, including the distinction between spatial versus scalar observations, and how these may differ from the commonly cited ``orders of resource selection''. We conclude by reviewing both existing and suggested alternatives to reduce the arbitrary nature of observational-scale choice prevalent in today's literature.},

This large-scale pattern is thought to arise because landscapes with favorable conditions for native species also have favorable conditions for exotic species. From theory, we proposed an alternative hypothesis: the positive relationship at large scales is driven by spatial heterogeneity in species composition, which is driven by spatial heterogeneity in the environment. Landscapes with more spatial heterogeneity in the environment can sustain more native and more exotic species, leading to a positive correlation of native and exotic diversity at large scales. In a nested data set for grassland plants, we detected negative relationships between native and exotic diversity at small spatial scales and positive relationships at large spatial scales. Supporting our hypothesis, the positive relationships between native and exotic diversity at large scales were driven by positive relationships between native and exotic beta diversity. Further, both native and exotic diversity were positively correlated with spatial heterogeneity in abiotic conditions (variance of soil depth, soil nitrogen, and aspect) but were uncorrelated with average abiotic conditions, supporting the spatial-heterogeneity hypothesis but not the favorable-conditions hypothesis.},

Using selected pattern metrics and data from 1973 and 2000 for the state of Maryland, we find significant increases in developed and undeveloped land fragmentation but substantial spatial heterogeneity as well. Estimated fragmentation gradients that describe mean fragmentation as a function of distance from urban centers confirm the hypotheses that fragmentation rises and falls with distance and that the point of maximum fragmentation shifted outward over time. However, rather than outward increases in sprawl balanced by development infill, we find substantial and significant increases in mean fragmentation values along the entire urban\textendash{}rural gradient. These findings are in contrast to the results of Burchfield et al. [Burchfield M, Overman HG, Puga D, Turner MA (2006) Q J Econ 121:587\textendash{}633], who conclude that the extent of sprawl remained roughly unchanged in the Unites States between 1976 and 1992. As demonstrated here, both the data and pattern measure used in their study are systematically biased against recording low-density residential development, the very land use that we find is most strongly associated with fragmentation. Other results demonstrate the association between exurban growth and increasing fragmentation and the systematic variation of fragmentation with nonurban factors. In particular, proximity to the Chesapeake Bay is negatively associated with fragmentation, suggesting that an attraction effect associated with this natural amenity has concentrated development.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to observe the effects of changing the grain (the first level of spatial resolution possible with a given data set) and extent (the total area of the study) of landscape data on observed spatial patterns and to identify some general rules for comparing measures obtained at different scales. Simple random maps, maps with contagion (i.e., clusters of the same land cover type), and actual landscape data from USGS land use (LUDA) data maps were used in the analyses. Landscape patterns were compared using indices measuring diversity (H), dominance (D) and contagion (C). Rare land cover types were lost as grain became coarser. This loss could be predicted analytically for random maps with two land cover types, and it was observed in actual landscapes as grain was increased experimentally. However, the rate of loss was influenced by the spatial pattern. Land cover types that were clumped disappeared slowly or were retained with increasing grain, whereas cover types that were dispersed were lost rapidly. The diversity index decreased linearly with increasing grain size, but dominance and contagion did not show a linear relationship. The indices D and C increased with increasing extent, but H exhibited a variable response. The indices were sensitive to the number (m) of cover types observed in the data set and the fraction of the landscape occupied by each cover type (Pk); both m and Pkvaried with grain and extent. Qualitative and quantitative changes in measurements across spatial scales will differ depending on how scale is defined. Characterizing the relationships between ecological measurements and the grain or extent of the data may make it possible to predict or correct for the loss of information with changes in spatial scale.},

I propose that these three traits, in large part, are the result of the action of predators on seeds and seedlings. A model is presented that allows detailed examination of the effect of different predators, dispersal agents, seed-crop sizes, etc. on these three traits. In short, any event that increases the efficiency of the predators at eating seeds and seedlings of a given tree species may lead to a reduction in population density of the adults of that species and/or to increased distance between new adults and their parents. Either event will lead to more space in the habitat for other species of trees, and therefore higher total number of tree species, provided seed sources are available over evolutionary time. As one moves from the wet lowland tropics to the dry tropics or temperate zones, the seed and seedling predators in a habitat are hypothesized to be progressively less efficient at keeping one or a few tree species from monopolizing the habitat through competitive superiority. This lowered efficiency of the predators is brought about by the increased severity and unpredictability of the physical environment, which in turn leads to regular or erratic escape of large seed or seedling cohorts from the predators.},

To examine how gap size and disturbance type influence the invasion of wet pine savannas by cogongrass, we performed three field experiments to evaluate the response of cogongrass seeds and transplanted seedlings to four different gap sizes, four types of site disturbance, and recent burning of savanna vegetation. Cogongrass germinated, survived, and grew in all gap sizes, from 0 to 100 cm in diameter. Similarly, disturbance type had no effect on germination or seedling and transplant survival. Tilling, however, significantly enhanced transplanted seedling growth, resulting in a tenfold increase in biomass over the other disturbance types. Seedling survival to 1 and 2 mo was greater in burned savanna than unburned savanna, although transplant survival and growth were not affected by burning. Results of this study suggest that cogongrass can germinate, survive, and grow in wet pine savanna communities regardless of gap size or type of disturbance, including burning. Burning of savanna vegetation may enhance establishment by improving early seedling survival, and soil disturbance can facilitate invasion of cogongrass by enhancing plant growth.},

  abstract = {High competitive ability has often been invoked as a key determinant of invasion success and ecological impacts of non-native plants. Yet our understanding of the strategies that non-natives use to gain competitive dominance remains limited. Particularly, it remains unknown whether the two non-mutually exclusive competitive strategies, neighbour suppression and neighbour tolerance, are equally important for the competitive advantage of non-native plants. Here, we analyse data from 192 peer-reviewed studies on pairwise plant competition within a Bayesian multilevel meta-analytic framework and show that non-native plants outperform their native counterparts due to high tolerance of competition, as opposed to strong suppressive ability. Competitive tolerance ability of non-native plants was driven by neighbour's origin and was expressed in response to a heterospecific native but not heterospecific non-native neighbour. In contrast to natives, non-native species were not more suppressed by hetero- vs. conspecific neighbours, which was partially due to higher intensity of intraspecific competition among non-natives. Heterogeneity in the data was primarily associated with methodological differences among studies and not with phylogenetic relatedness among species. Altogether, our synthesis demonstrates that non-native plants are competitively distinct from native plants and challenges the common notion that neighbour suppression is the primary strategy for plant invasion success.},

  abstract = {The use of both linear and generalized linear mixed-effects models (LMMs and GLMMs) has become popular not only in social and medical sciences, but also in biological sciences, especially in the field of ecology and evolution. Information criteria, such as Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), are usually presented as model comparison tools for mixed-effects models. The presentation of `variance explained' (R2) as a relevant summarizing statistic of mixed-effects models, however, is rare, even though R2 is routinely reported for linear models (LMs) and also generalized linear models (GLMs). R2 has the extremely useful property of providing an absolute value for the goodness-of-fit of a model, which cannot be given by the information criteria. As a summary statistic that describes the amount of variance explained, R2 can also be a quantity of biological interest. One reason for the under-appreciation of R2 for mixed-effects models lies in the fact that R2 can be defined in a number of ways. Furthermore, most definitions of R2 for mixed-effects have theoretical problems (e.g. decreased or negative R2 values in larger models) and/or their use is hindered by practical difficulties (e.g. implementation). Here, we make a case for the importance of reporting R2 for mixed-effects models. We first provide the common definitions of R2 for LMs and GLMs and discuss the key problems associated with calculating R2 for mixed-effects models. We then recommend a general and simple method for calculating two types of R2 (marginal and conditional R2) for both LMMs and GLMMs, which are less susceptible to common problems. This method is illustrated by examples and can be widely employed by researchers in any fields of research, regardless of software packages used for fitting mixed-effects models. The proposed method has the potential to facilitate the presentation of R2 for a wide range of circumstances.},

  abstract = {Recently, a debate has developed over how biodiversity is changing across the planet. While most researchers agree species extinctions are increasing globally due to human activity, some now argue that species richness at local scales is not declining as many biologists have claimed. This argument stems from recent syntheses of timeseries data that suggest species richness is decreasing in some locations, increasing in others, but not changing on average. Critics of these syntheses (like us) have argued there are serious limitations of existing time-series datasets and their analyses that preclude meaningful conclusions about local biodiversity change. Specifically, authors of these syntheses have failed to account for several primary drivers of biodiversity change, have relied on data poor time-series that lack baselines needed to detect change, and have unreasonably extrapolated conclusions. Here we summarize the history of this debate, as well as key papers and exchanges that have helped clarify new issues and ideas. To resolve the debate, we suggest future researchers be more clear about the hypotheses of biodiversity change being tested, focus less on amassing large datasets, and more on amassing high-quality datasets that provide unambiguous tests of the hypotheses. Researchers should also keep track of the contributions that native versus non-native species make to biodiversity time trends, as these have different implications for conservation. Lastly, we suggest researchers be aware of pros and cons of using different types of data (e.g., time-series, spatial comparisons), taking care to resolve divergent results among sources to allow broader conclusions about biodiversity change.},

  abstract = {The use of structural equation modeling (SEM) is often motivated by its utility for investigating complex networks of relationships, but also because of its promise as a means of representing theoretical concepts using latent variables. In this paper, we discuss characteristics of ecological theory and some of the challenges for proper specification of theoretical ideas in structural equation models (SE models). In our presentation, we describe some of the requirements for classical latent variable models in which observed variables (indicators) are interpreted as the effects of underlying causes. We also describe alternative model specifications in which indicators are interpreted as having causal influences on the theoretical concepts. We suggest that this latter nonclassical specification (which involves another variable type\textemdash{}the composite) will often be appropriate for ecological studies because of the multifaceted nature of our theoretical concepts. In this paper, we employ the use of meta-models to aid the translation of theory into SE models and also to facilitate our ability to relate results back to our theories. We demonstrate our approach by showing how a synthetic theory of grassland biodiversity can be evaluated using SEM and data from a coastal grassland. In this example, the theory focuses on the responses of species richness to abiotic stress and disturbance, both directly and through intervening effects on community biomass. Models examined include both those based on classical forms (where each concept is represented using a single latent variable) and also ones in which the concepts are recognized to be multifaceted and modeled as such. To address the challenge of matching SE models with the conceptual level of our theory, two approaches are illustrated, compositing and aggregation. Both approaches are shown to have merits, with the former being preferable for cases where the multiple facets of a concept have widely differing effects in the system and the latter being preferable where facets act together consistently when influencing other parts of the system. Because ecological theory characteristically deals with concepts that are multifaceted, we expect the methods presented in this paper will be useful for ecologists wishing to use SEM.},

  abstract = {Understanding long-term coexistence of numerous competing species is a longstanding challenge in ecology. Progress requires determining which processes and species differences are most important for coexistence when multiple processes operate and species differ in many ways. Modern coexistence theory (MCT), formalised by Chesson, holds out the promise of doing that, but empirical applications remain scarce. We argue that MCT's mathematical complexity and subtlety have obscured the simplicity and power of its underlying ideas and hindered applications. We present a general computational approach that extends our previous solution for the storage effect to all of standard MCT's spatial and temporal coexistence mechanisms, and also process-defined mechanisms amenable to direct study such as resource partitioning, indirect competition, and life history trade-offs. The main components are a method to partition population growth rates into contributions from different mechanisms and their interactions, and numerical calculations in which some mechanisms are removed and others retained. We illustrate how our approach handles features that have not been analysed in the standard framework through several case studies: competing diatom species under fluctuating temperature, plant\textendash{}soil feedbacks in grasslands, facilitation in a beach grass community, and niche differences with independent effects on recruitment, survival and growth in sagebrush steppe.},

  abstract = {Climatically controlled allocation to reproduction is a key mechanism by which climate influences tree growth and may explain lagged correlations between climate and growth. We used continent-wide datasets of tree-ring chronologies and annual reproductive effort in Fagus sylvatica from 1901 to 2015 to characterise relationships between climate, reproduction and growth. Results highlight that variable allocation to reproduction is a key factor for growth in this species, and that high reproductive effort (`mast years') is associated with stem growth reduction. Additionally, high reproductive effort is associated with previous summer temperature, creating lagged climate effects on growth. Consequently, understanding growth variability in forest ecosystems requires the incorporation of reproduction, which can be highly variable. Our results suggest that future response of growth dynamics to climate change in this species will be strongly influenced by the response of reproduction.},

Analytic approaches varied widely across the teams, and the estimated effect sizes ranged from 0.89 to 2.93 (Mdn = 1.31) in odds-ratio units. Twenty teams (69\%) found a statistically significant positive effect, and 9 teams (31\%) did not observe a significant relationship. Overall, the 29 different analyses used 21 unique combinations of covariates. Neither analysts' prior beliefs about the effect of interest nor their level of expertise readily explained the variation in the outcomes of the analyses. Peer ratings of the quality of the analyses also did not account for the variability. These findings suggest that significant variation in the results of analyses of complex data may be difficult to avoid, even by experts with honest intentions.

In turn, community assembly can be driven by many processes, including resource enrichment. To test the hypothesis that community assembly causally links host diversity to future disease, we experimentally manipulated host diversity and resource supply to hosts, then allowed communities to assemble for 2 years (surveyed 2012\textendash{}2014). Initially, host diversity increased disease. Subsequently, host diversity did not directly alter disease. However, host diversity determined the trajectory of host community assembly, altering colonisation by exotic host species and richness-independent host phylogenetic diversity, which together reversed the initial increase in disease. Ultimately, incorporating the temporal dimension of community assembly revealed novel mechanisms linking host diversity to future disease.},

  abstract = {Ecological data often exhibit spatial pattern, which can be modeled as autocorrelation. Conditional autoregressive (CAR) and simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) models are network-based models (also known as graphical models) specifically designed to model spatially autocorrelated data based on neighborhood relationships. We identify and discuss six different types of practical ecological inference using CAR and SAR models, including: (1) model selection, (2) spatial regression, (3) estimation of autocorrelation, (4) estimation of other connectivity parameters, (5) spatial prediction, and (6) spatial smoothing. We compare CAR and SAR models, showing their development and connection to partial correlations. Special cases, such as the intrinsic autoregressive model (IAR), are described. Conditional autoregressive and SAR models depend on weight matrices, whose practical development uses neighborhood definition and row-standardization. Weight matrices can also include ecological covariates and connectivity structures, which we emphasize, but have been rarely used. Trends in harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) in southeastern Alaska from 463 polygons, some with missing data, are used to illustrate the six inference types. We develop a variety of weight matrices and CAR and SAR spatial regression models are fit using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. Profile likelihood graphs illustrate inference for covariance parameters. The same data set is used for both prediction and smoothing, and the relative merits of each are discussed. We show the nonstationary variances and correlations of a CAR model and demonstrate the effect of row-standardization. We include several take-home messages for CAR and SAR models, including (1) choosing between CAR and IAR models, (2) modeling ecological effects in the covariance matrix, (3) the appeal of spatial smoothing, and (4) how to handle isolated neighbors. We highlight several reasons why ecologists will want to make use of autoregressive models, both directly and in hierarchical models, and not only in explicit spatial settings, but also for more general connectivity models.},

Ecosystem C stocks are not well understood in longleaf pine forests, which are typically of low density and maintained by prescribed fire. The objectives of this research were to develop allometric equations for above- and below-ground biomass and quantify ecosystem C stocks in five longleaf pine forests ranging in age from 5 to 87 years and in basal area from 0.4 to 22.6 m2$\cdot$ha-1. Live aboveground C (woody plant + ground cover) and live root C (longleaf pine below stump + plot level coarse roots + plot level fine roots) ranged from 1.4 and 2.9 Mg C$\cdot$ha-1, respectively, in the 5-year-old stand to 78.4 and 19.2 Mg C$\cdot$ha-1, respectively, in the 87-year-old stand. Total ecosystem C (live plant + dead organic matter + mineral soil) values were 71.6, 110.1, 124.6, 141.4, and 185.4 Mg C$\cdot$ha-1 in the 5-, 12-, 21-, 64-, and 87-year-old stands, respectively, and dominated by tree C and soil C. In the 5-year-old stand, ground cover C and residual taproot C were significant C stocks. This unique, in-depth assessment of aboveand below-ground C across a series of longleaf pine stands will improve estimates of C in longleaf pine ecosystems and contribute to development of general biomass models that account for variation in climate, site, and management history in an important but understudied ecosystem.},

Smoke from global biomass burning has had significant and widespread ecological and human health consequences, but the living component of smoke has received little attention. Microbes aerosolized and transported by wildland fire may have profound effects on atmospheric and environmental factors, acting as nuclei for ice condensation, transporting pathogens or symbionts, and otherwise influencing ecosystems and human populations downwind. The potential for smoke to aerosolize and transport viable microbes is a virtually blank piece of the microbial biogeography puzzle with farreaching implications. This study characterized the aerosolization of viable microbes via wildland fire smoke from burns in contrasting coniferous forests. Seventy aerosolized microbial morphotypes were recovered, and of these, a subset was identified using DNA analysis which revealed both pathogenic and non-pathogenic fungal species. Overall microbial colony-forming units decreased with increasing distance from smoke source, driven by bacterial abundance. Organisms were more abundant in smoke derived from mechanically treated fuels than intact forest floors and were most abundant in smoke from a dry, biennially burned Pinus palustris sandhill forest in Florida. Our findings of smoke-transported viable microbes have implications for ecosystem restoration/conservation, global biodiversity, meteorology, and human health.},

These effects can vary based on forest age and may be influenced by differences in traits of native and invasive plant species. To determine how native versus invasive plant species respond to forest edges and forest successional age, we experimentally evaluated germination, survival, and growth of three native and three invasive woody plant species in eastern USA forests. Across all species, increasing distance from the edge resulted in more germination and less seedling growth, but had no effect on seedling survival. Generally, seedling growth was greater in younger forests and invasive species outperformed native species; however, there were significant species-specific differences in performance. For example, among native species, spicebush had poor growth performance but high survival, while redbud had low germination but high growth performance and survival. By contrast, the invasive privet and autumn olive produced more biomass with high relative growth rates, and autumn olive had exceptionally high germination but the lowest survival. Overall, our results suggest that while there are some general characteristics of invasive species, species-specific traits may better inform management strategies and improve predictions about biological invasions along forest edges.},

By area, 70\% of US prescribed burns take place in the Southeast, where treatment objectives range widely and accomplishing them depends on finding specific weather conditions for the effective and controlled application of fire. The climatological variation of the preferred weather window is examined here using two weather model reanalyses, with focus on conditions critical to smoke dispersion and erratic fire behaviour. Large spatial gradients were evident in some months (e.g. 3\^A change across the Appalachian Mountains in winter). Over most of the Southeast, availability of preferred conditions in summer was several (up to 8) times less than in autumn or winter. We offer explanation for this variability in terms of the mean seasonal changes of key weather conditions (especially mixing height and transport wind). We also examine the interannual variability of the preferred weather window for linkage to the tropical Pacific (1979\textendash{}2010). Associations with the subset of El Nin\texttildelow{}o events identified by outgoing-longwave-radiation suggest skilful seasonal fire weather forecasts are feasible. Together, these findings offer a predictive tool to prioritise allocation of scarce prescribed fire resources and maximise annual area treated across this landscape.},

In a range of scenarios, the highest spillover risk occurs at intermediate levels of habitat loss, whereas the largest, but rarest, epidemics occur at extremes of land conversion. This framework provides insights into the mechanisms driving disease emergence and spillover during land conversion.

  abstract = {Current theory in disturbance ecology predicts that extreme disturbances in rapid succession can lead to dramatic changes in species composition or ecosystem processes due to interactions among disturbances. However, the extent to which less catastrophic, yet chronic, disturbances such as wind damage and fire interact is not well studied. In this study, we simulated wind-caused gaps in a Pinus taeda forest in the Piedmont of north-central Georgia using static winching of trees to examine how wind damage may alter fuel characteristics and the behavior of subsequent prescribed fire. We found that experimental wind disturbance increased levels of fine and coarse woody fuels (but not leaf litter), increased spatial heterogeneity of fuels, and led to more complete consumption of leaf litter. These patterns led to changes in fire combustion characteristics in experimental gap plots within areas of downed tree crowns where we observed a large increase in fire radiative flux density (kWm-2) and its time integral, fire radiative energy density (MJm-2). These results suggest that wind disturbance may interact with fire not only through addition of fuel, but also through more subtle changes in fuel composition, consumption, and arrangement. More broadly, this study shows that disturbances can influence one another via a variety of mechanisms not all of which are immediately obvious. Understanding disturbance interactions can allow forest managers to make more informed decisions about how wind disturbance influences fuel heterogeneity, and how management processes, such as prescribed fire can interact with other prior wind disturbances to interactively shape plant communities.},

We selected 3 species of exotic grasses common to the Southeast and review the literature on their regional distribution, ecosystem impacts, wildlife impacts, and management. These grasses have the potential to harm indigenous wildlife species, such as northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), that need grasslands with a shrub component for nesting, brood-rearing, and loafing. These exotic, invasive grasses are sod-forming in nature, typically forming dense monotypic stands that provide little bare ground and have low plant species and insect diversity. Furthermore, it appears that wildlife do not prefer to consume these plant species. Control is often difficult and usually requires the use of herbicides in combination with mechanical treatment, such as disking, to provide adequate habitat. Attempts should be encouraged to convert these idle grasslands to a mixture of native grasses and forbs to make stands more suitable for wildlife species.

In-fire video of flame-front passage and time series data from very fine exposed thermocouples were used to estimate the duration of passage of the main flaming front in these experimental fires. Flame temperature measured at points within the flame was found to vary with height; maximum flame temperature was greater in the tall shrub fuel than in the low shrub fuel sites. A model to estimate flame temperature at any height within a flame of a specific height was developed. The maximum flame temperature observed was \textasciitilde{}1100$^\circ$C near the flame base and, when observation height was normalised by flame height, flame temperature exponentially decreased to the visible flame tip where temperatures were \textasciitilde{}300$^\circ$C. Maximum flame temperature was significantly correlated with rate of spread, fire intensity, flame height and surface fuel bulk density. Average flame-front residence time for eucalypt forest fuels was 37 s and did not vary significantly with fine fuel moisture, fuel quantity or bulk density.},

  abstract = {Species intolerant to fire, defined as lacking adaptations needed to establish dominance in a frequently burned landscape, are found within fire-prone ecosystems globally. Such species are frequently targeted for reduction or eradication to further conservation or restoration of biological diversity because the dominant paradigm in restoration of fire-dependent communities is to reduce the dominance or eliminate fire-intolerant invaders. To explore this paradigm, we examined the role of oaks (Quercus spp.) within fire-dependent upland and sandhill longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystems of the southeastern United States. These pine-oak ecosystems have among the highest levels of biodiversity in the temperate zone. This diversity is inextricably linked to a frequent fire regime and includes many species readily top-killed by fire, particularly oaks, which were common in the early settlement landscape. In examining the diversity of oak species found within longleaf pine ecosystems, we identify a group of pyrophytic oaks and show that these oaks are critical components of sandhill and other longleaf pine ecosystems, and their occurrence should be considered as part of conservation and restoration goals. Providing a better understanding of the ecological role of such species will benefit conservation management and strategic planning in fire-prone southeastern ecosystems and more broadly where fire is used as a management tool. \textcopyright{} 2014 The Wildlife Society.},

  abstract = {Wildfires play an important role in vegetation composition and structure, nutrient fluxes, human health and wealth, and are interlinked with climate change. Plants have an influence on wildfire behaviour and predicting this feedback is a high research priority. For upscaling from leaf traits to wildfire behaviour we need to know if the same leaf traits are important for the flammability of 1) individual leaves, and 2) multiple leaves packed in fuel beds. Based on a conceptual framework, we hypothesised that fuel packing properties, through airflow limitation, would overrule the effects of individual leaf morphology and chemistry. To test this hypothesis we compared the results of two experiments, respectively addressing individual leaf flammability and monospecific fuel bed flammability of 25 perennial species from eastern Australia. Across species, fuel bed packing ratio and bulk density scaled negatively with fire spread and positively with maximum temperature and burning time. Species with `curlier' leaves, higher specific leaf area, lower tannin concentrations and lower tissue density promoted faster fire spread through fuel beds. We found that species with shorter individual leaf ignition times had a faster fire spread, shorter burning times and lower temperatures in fuel beds. Leaf traits that affect the flammability of individual leaves (e.g. specific leaf area), continue to do so even when packed in fuel beds. While previous studies have focused on either flammability of individual plant particles or fire behaviour in fuel beds, this is the first time that an overarching combination of the two approaches was made for a wide range of species. Our findings provide a better understanding of fuel bed flammability based on interspecific variation in morphological and some chemical leaf traits. This can be a first step in linking leaf traits to fire behaviour in the field.},

The diversity of parasitic organisms likely correlates with the hosts they live in and the number mammal hosts for zoonotic infections increases with species richness among mammalian orders. Thus, while habitat loss and fragmentation may reduce species diversity, the habitat encroachment by people into species-rich areas may increase the exposure of people to novel infectious agents from wildlife. Here, we present a theoretical framework that exploits the species\textendash{}area relationship to link the exposure of people to novel infections with habitat biodiversity. We model changes in human exposure to microbes through defined classes of habitat fragmentation and predict that increased habitat division intrinsically increases the hazard from microbes for all modelled biological systems. We apply our model to African tropical forests as an example. Our results suggest that it is possible to identify high-risk areas for the mitigation and surveillance of novel disease emergence and that mitigation measures may reduce this risk while conserving biodiversity.},

  abstract = {The disease triangle is a basic and highly flexible tool used extensively in forest pathology. By linking host, pathogen, and environmental factors, the model provides etiological insights into disease emergence. Landscape ecology, as a field, focuses on spatially heterogeneous environments and is most often employed to understand the dynamics of relatively large areas such as those including multiple ecosystems (a landscape) or regions (multiple landscapes). Landscape ecology is increasingly focused on the role of co-occurring, overlapping, or interacting disturbances in shaping spatial heterogeneity as well as understanding how disturbance interactions mediate ecological impacts. Forest diseases can result in severe landscape-level mortality which could influence a range of other landscape-level disturbances including fire, wind impacts, and land use among others. However, apart from a few important exceptions, these disturbance-disease interactions are not well studied. We unite aspects of forest pathology with landscape ecology by applying the disease-triangle approach from the perspective of a spatially heterogeneous environment. At the landscape-scale, disturbances such as fire, insect outbreak, wind, and other events can be components of the environmental `arm' of the disease triangle, meaning that a rich base of forest pathology can be leveraged to understand how disturbances are likely to impact diseases. Reciprocal interactions between disease and disturbance are poorly studied but landscape ecology has developed tools that can identify how they affect the dynamics of ecosystems and landscapes.},

Recent advances to resurrect or prevent the loss of species by developing resistant hybrids hold promise, but uncertainty remains about the potential impacts of introducing a novel genotype on ecological processes, such as fire. A classic example of a non-native, pathogen-caused loss of a foundation species is American chestnut (Castanea dentata), a species now functionally extinct from the eastern US but undergoing experimental trials to resurrect the species with a putatively disease-resistant genotype. We compared the litter flammability among American chestnut, Chinese chestnut (C. mollisima), and a population of first intercross, third-generation backcrossed hybrid (BC3F2) using laboratory burning experiments. Litter flammability of American chestnut was consistently greater than Chinese chestnut, whereas the hybrid had an intermediate flammability or more closely resembled Chinese chestnut flammability by some measures. Greater flammability in American chestnut was associated with a longer leaf structure with greater curling when dry. American chestnut had flammability properties consistent with other pyrophytic species present in contemporary fire-prone ecosystems. The loss of American chestnut may have altered litter flammability of some eastern US forest ecosystems, a result more commonly associated with compositional changes in conjunction with fire exclusion and other disturbances. Resurrecting American chestnut with a hybrid genotype may mitigate this change in areas where less flammable species have replaced American chestnut. Resurrection of lost foundation species through introduction of resistant genotypes may represent a resounding ecological success story, but unanticipated changes to ecological processes, such as fire, should be considered.},

Research on plant flammability is rapidly increasing but commonly only considers a single fuel scale. In some cases, however, different fuel scales (e.g. leaf and litter bed) have greater influence on fire, for instance, when it spreads from the litter bed to the lower canopy. Examining fuel flammability at these different scales is necessary to better know the overall flammability but also provides insights into the drivers of flammability. To investigate if leaf and litter bed flammability differed, laboratory experiments were conducted on 15 species (native or exotic) commonly found in the WUI of south-eastern France. Species were ranked and the association of fuel characteristics with flammability sought at both scales. For most species, leaf and litter bed flammability differed because of strong fuel characteristics (e.g. leaf thickness or litter bulk density), entailing differences in rankings based on fuel scale and potentially leading to a misrepresentation of flammability of the species studied. Favouring species with lower flammability at both scales in the WUI, especially near housing, may help reduce undesired effects during wildfires.},

I experimentally manipulated canopies of Adenostoma fasciculatum, a California shrub that naturally retains dead branches, to mimic degrees of self-pruning in four small-scale (4 m \# 6 m) treatments: removal of all canopy dead wood, clipping of all dead wood with wood left as litter, an unmanipulated treatment, and a dead wood addition. Treatment plots were burned in large-scale prescribed fires. Fire temperatures and heat release were significantly higher in Unmanipulated and Addition treatments, demonstrating a significant local effect of dead branch retention.

The comparison of flammability results showed that the sampling method had a significant effect on litter bulk-density, rate of spread and rate of consumption, intact litter being more flammable than reconstructed litter that was artificially compacted. The type of vegetation had a significant effect on litter depth, ignitability, sustainability, consumability and combustibility (except on rate of spread) and the litter composition could explain in part this fire behaviour. The effect of the construction of litters on flammability parameters and its magnitude also differed according to vegetation types. Intact litter structure appeared to be an important driver of its flammability, especially of combustibility and consumability. The assessment of these flammability components will differ when using constructed litter samples instead of intact litter samples, especially according to vegetation types. Future research on litter flammability should take into account the bias due to the litter sampling method when the litter is constructed.},

Differences in flammability were not strongly driven by leaf habit, leaf margin type, or surface area to volume ratio; simple measures of leaf size accounted for most of the observed variation. Further, leaf size was tightly linked to fuelbed depth, a known driver of fire behavior. Litter from trees was generally more flammable than litter from shrubs, primarily a function of differences in leaf size. A hierarchical clustering analysis on the flammability data set divided the oaks into three clusters of low, intermediate, and high flammability, corresponding closely to high-, mixed-, and low-severity fire regimes, respectively.

By contrast, little is known about tree growth response to projected declines in winter snowpack and increases in soil freezing in seasonally snow-covered forest ecosystems, despite extensive documentation of the importance of winter climate in mediating ecological processes. We conducted a 5-year snow-removal experiment whereby snow was removed for the first 4\textendash{}5 weeks of winter in a northern hardwood forest at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire, USA. Our results indicate that adverse impacts of reduced snowpack and increased soil freezing on the physiology of Acer saccharum (sugar maple), a dominant species across northern temperate forests, are accompanied by a 40 $\pm$ 3\% reduction in aboveground woody biomass increment, averaged across the 6 years following the start of the experiment. Further, we find no indication of growth recovery 1 year after cessation of the experiment. Based on these findings, we integrate spatial modeling of snowpack depth with forest inventory data to develop a spatially explicit, regional-scale assessment of the vulnerability of forest aboveground growth to projected declines in snowpack depth and increased soil frost. These analyses indicate that nearly 65\% of sugar maple basal area in the northeastern United States resides in areas that typically experience insulating snowpack. However, under the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 emissions scenarios, we project a 49\%\textendash{}95\% reduction in forest area experiencing insulating snowpack by the year 2099 in the northeastern United States, leaving large areas of northern forest vulnerable to these changes in winter climate, particularly along the northern edge of the region.

  abstract = {There is increasing recognition that plant traits contribute to variations in fire behavior and fire regime. Diversity across species in litter flammability and canopy flammability has been documented in many woody plants. Grasses, however, are often considered homogeneous fuels in which any flammability differences across species are attributable to biomass differences alone and therefore are of less ecological interest, because biomass is hugely plastic. We examined the effect of grass canopy architecture on flammability across eight grass species in short grass steppe of New Mexico and Texas. To characterize grass canopy architecture, we measured biomass density and \&ldquo;biomass-height ratio\&rdquo; (the ratio of canopy biomass above 10 cm to that of biomass below 10 cm). Indoor flammability experiments were performed on air-dried individual plants. As expected, plant biomass influenced all flammability measures. However, biomass-height ratio had additional negative effect on temperature exposure at soil surface (accumulation of mean temperature \&gt;100 \&deg;C) in well-cured grasses, which is an important fire behavior metric predicting soil heating and meristem survival. This canopy architecture effect, however, needs further investigation to be isolated from biomass density due to correlation of these two traits. This result demonstrates the potential for species-specific variation in architecture to influence local fire effects in grasses.},

  abstract = {Three aspects of the p\'aramo vegetation's response to fires were investigated: the measurement of fire temperatures, general observations of changes in plant communities following fires, and monitoring the fate of individual plants after burning.Fire temperatures were strongly influenced by the physiognomy of the vegetation, dominated by tussocks of Calamagrostis spp. Temperatures were highest amongst the upper leaves of the tussock (sometimes $>$500$^\circ$C). The middle levels of the tussock experienced temperatures in excess of 400$^\circ$C, but in the dense leaf bases temperatures were often below 65$^\circ$C. On the ground between tussocks, temperatures were variable, whereas 2 cm below ground temperatures failed to reach 65$^\circ$C.Plant survival depended on the intensity of the fire and the plant's position within the tussock structure. Survival was often the result of high temperature avoidance (with buds shielded by other plant parts or buried beneath the soil surface).Post-fire Calamagrostis tiller mortality rates were high and tussock regrowth was slow. Some other species appear to maintain their populations by exploiting this recovery phase for seedling establishment on tussocks.Between tussocks, changes of occupancy at the level of the individual plants were greater after fire than in control vegetation. Most transitions were random. Those which departed from random often involved gaps and were related to post-fire mortality, regrowth from below-ground parts, colonisation or, in the case of a clonal mat-forming species, to spatial rearrangement of rosettes. Recovery was slower at higher altitude. Recovery was much slower in burned plots when the upper 2 cm of soil was removed (along with buried plant parts) compared with burned plots.Qualitative observations suggest that recovery may consist of a cyclical process, mediated by the serial dominance of several species that are physiognomically important.The frequency of fires determines the amount of fuel accumulated within grass tussocks and some plants may be unable to survive repeated burning. Chance survival of species in unburned patches of vegetation and random colonisation of gaps may be important determinants of subsequent community structure.},

As indicated by conflicting advice in such lists, such characterisation is not without difficulties and disagreements. The flammability of vegetation is often described as having four components (ignitability, combustibility, sustainability and consumability). No standards or generally recognised test procedures exist for evaluating these components in plants. Some measurements of flammability include times for ignition, rate of flame spread, flame height and heat release rate. Often, the fire behaviour characteristics of a plant are derived from its physical and chemical characteristics. Thermogravimetric analysis and other thermal analyses of ground samples have long been used to characterise the thermal degradation of vegetation. More recently, researchers have used the oxygen consumption methodology to measure the heat released due to combustion of the vegetation. Although oxygen consumption calorimetry is an improvement in characterising plant flammability, translation of laboratory results to field conditions can be problematic and tests can be expensive.},

Scientifically, it can be defined through three component variables that describe how well the fuel ignites (ignitibility), how well it burns (combustibility) and how long it burns (sustainability). The `fuel' may be a plant organ, a whole plant or a plant community. While the terms ignitibility, combustibility and sustainability have been developed for laboratory studies, there are conceptual equivalents suited to the field; these are rate of spread, intensity and residence times. Another variable is added for field circumstances \textemdash{} probability of burning at a point. Eucalypt forests can be highly `flammable' even considering all criteria and scales, while Australian forests in general show the whole range of variation from low (`closed forests' or `rainforests') to high (e.g. relatively short stringy-barked open forests of Eucalyptus with abundant wiregrass). The expression of flammability depends on the local circumstances. In the field this can be summarised in terms of weather, terrain and ignition. Predicting how much potential forest fuel, and the attributes of that fuel, will be involved at any particular time, and under extreme weather conditions, remains a challenge. How social, climatic and fuel-species' changes will affect flammability, directly and indirectly, in the next 50\textendash{}100 y is uncertain but potentially very significant.},

Physical, chemical and architectural properties of plants are known to affect flammability. We wished to explore how these traits contribute to fire properties at the individual species level and how flammability varies with other plant traits, including recruitment strategy. We studied flammability and traits that contribute to it in 29 woody species occurring in fynbos and renosterveld shrublands in the Cape region of South Africa. Fifteen of the species had fire-stimulated recruitment and 14 recruit in unburnt, older vegetation. Flammability was measured on whole plants or large shoots with intact architecture. Results across all species were consistent with other studies in finding that the proportions of dead and fine fuel are good predictors of flammability. Significantly higher flame temperatures and proportions of sample units burnt were recorded for fire-stimulated vs. non-fire-stimulated recruiters. These differences were associated with significant differences in the dead fuel proportion and fuel bed porosity between recruitment strategies. This is consistent with the hypothesis that flammability is most likely to be selected for in species that are the first to occupy post-burn gaps, where a combination of increased flammability and recruitment success enhances their fitness in the fire-prone environment.},
